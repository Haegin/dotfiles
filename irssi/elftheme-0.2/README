This is a sample config for Irssi. It includes a theme, but that's really only
a small part. The spiffiest stuff is done via scripts :) This means that Perl
support is mandatory. If your Irssi is compiled with Perl support as a module,
add a line to ~/.irssi/startup, which is: "/load perl".

I have included some sample hilights. They'll hilight everything that would
normally be aimed at me. It does catch false positives, occasionally. You can
remove them with the /HILIGHT command. They're pretty nasty. If anybody wants
to give a go at rewriting them for me, I'd be grateful :)

The subdirectory elf-theme/irssi/ is the stuff that would normally be in
~/.irssi

Special thanks go to cras, aka Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi> for creating an
*AMAZING* communications client. I pity those who can't use IRC because so
many of their friends are on other "chat" networks - they're missing out on a
great client.

Enjoy, and report any bugs or suggestions or praise to eelf@sympatico.ca :)
