#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin_, but would Somerfields sell me a blender?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin_, aye, but I can also get couscous elsewhere :P
#cs-york         julian- Haegin: Tell me if you want suggestions from Which?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: On the other hand, Apple are vaguely competent
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: It's a bit of a saga. Google jwz's livejournal
#cs-york   Sparkesinator Haegin, what do you want to know about java?
#cs-york   Sparkesinator Haegin, i have a HTC Hero atm, (couldnt afford WM device i wanted)
#cs-york   Sparkesinator Haegin, Orange, T-Mobile, Vodaphone all have Andorid phones
#cs-york   Sparkesinator Haegin, the App Store is quite good, lots of apps, but i have no idea about developing for it
#cs-york   Sparkesinator Haegin, you can get them sim free and depending what you want they start abotu about £175
#cs-york   Sparkesinator Haegin, theres alot of shit free apps, but also some great free ones, like Beebplayer
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin_: It's pretty much impossible without a Mac.
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin_: for useful reference: On posterous you can make things code snippets by surrounding them with [code][/code]
#cs-york   Sparkesinator Haegin, Cyqwin
#cs-york         laser` |  Haegin_: MikTeX?
#cs-york         julian- Haegin: A lack of caffeine?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, lack of water?

#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, shes finishing her report
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin_: lyx or miktex probably
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin_: lyx is quite nice also, but not the same as latex exactly.
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, thats slightly harsh
#cs-york          miket |  Haegin_: it's ancient greek
#cs-york          BidMod the followup question: is there any hacksoc committee left in York to organise it? ;P
#cs-york          BidMod thanks Haegin

#cs-york          BidMod Haegin, you could share some of what Jens is up to... although obviously not all
^Tom_ see msn message about bike.
nessieliberation_ eg the hybrid i was looking at ages ago is down by another 50 quid (though no longer with freebie or free shipping)
nessieliberation_ and the 500 quid tourer I wanted is 350 (+13 shipping), so I bought it.
^Tom_ oki
^Tom_ basically, bike outlet sale just got better
^Tom_ the 500 quid tourer I wanted I've just bought for 350
^Tom_ and the hybrid i was looking at ages ago is down ANOTHER 50
^Tom_ from 350 to 220
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin_: SLC and MLC, I know that much.
^Tom_ road bike?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin_: Speed, why else?
^Tom_ what shifters have you got?
^Tom_ down tube or on the bars?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin_: On my hard drive?
^Tom_ I know someone with a mountain bike he built, costs were/are about 500+ frame, 400+ (now 500ish) front forks, brakes about 160ish etc etc etc
^Tom_ sadly it's not actually worth much money, other than being a very good bike.
^Tom_ ie, if he sells it, it'd probably be 3-400
^Tom_ but he might split it down to parts instead.
^Tom_ but if you know anyone who wants it, i can put them in touch.
^Tom_ sure.
^Tom_ he's picking up a rather nice roady hybrid thing from a small indy manufacturer tomorrow
^Tom_ but i can't remember what it is
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin_: I just ran Xbench: http://db.xbench.com/merge.xhtml?doc1=397063
^Tom_ also...
^Tom_ you might be interested to see:
^Tom_ http://juggling.tv/ <-- the video a friend made
^Tom_ filmed around York.
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin_: what disks?

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: a lot of the mew stdlib atm is stuff like that to make things read cleanly
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: Python?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: dd if=/dev/rootpartion of=/somethingnotonit

#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, they goverment did it for 2 reasons, 1) save the economy, saving jobs. 2) it was goverment interferences (here and the US - Freedy May and Fannie Mac) that messed up the markets, by trying to increase lending to people who couldnt afford it (sub prime), so the goverments had to correct their mistake.

^Tom_ that's a very good question.
^Tom_ one to which i currently don't have an answer, but am looking at a couple of plans.
^Tom_ a) i might see how much helen's old house on garths end is, and get around to finding out earlier rather than later.
^Tom_ b) my current house is seriously cheap, but could be a bit bigger.
^Tom_ c) if i'm staying around in york for a long time, i might look at buying.
^Tom_ c part 2) and you've just reminded me to check a set of particulars
^Tom_ oooh, it's better and cheaper than i was expecting
^Tom_ 2.08 x 2.03 is bloomin' tiny for a bedroom, isn't it
^Tom_ I'm certainly interested.
^Tom_ btw...
^Tom_ did you ever see helen's house in our freshers year?
^Tom_ huge living room & amazing kitchen
^Tom_ downstairs loo and 3 reasonably sized rooms.
^Tom_ i've actually got the landlord's number, as i was going to express interest last year, but never got around to it.
^Tom_ erm, garths end, off erm, the continuation of the link
^Tom_ http://osm.org/go/evpPtsgkT--
^Tom_ on the grants avenue/garths end corner
^Tom_ but then my current house might still be as cheap next year (200 per week, 4 bedrooms).
nessieliberation hiho
nessieliberation how much of that did you get?
nessieliberation oki, good, that's what i sent.
nessieliberation helen's house was much nicer, but mine is about as cheap as you can get around here.
nessieliberation when she was there, it was below 60 pppw, but i know it went up.
nessieliberation 07528812004
nessieliberation that's the phone number of the landlord
nessieliberation re: 4th person, I don't know what jason is planning on doing.
nessieliberation oki, bye

david224 yes i did just  look, did not you also want to replace your zen as well
david224 well  a ipod touch, would act like the diray part of your shinny phone and an Ipod and then you spend the 50 on a reasonable standard phone
david224 for 350 pounds
david224 less then the 360+ 100ish  on a per and ipod

adrianracu ha
adrianracu could've used linux
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: I know you don't do it anymore, but do CompRec do plugboards?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, Which backstreet boy is gay
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: no, it's the fscking "civil partner" bit
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, your point? that a cli enviroment, would have ment i wouldnt have had to spend 3 hours reading oAuth documentation to find the person who wrote this codes mistake?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, oh i know its terrible isnt it
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: it's already replacing Meteor in a few places
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Why are you fiddling with colour schemes now?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i'm not kidding
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: http://hosting.nitescifi.com/upload/1255377185.png
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: oh, you meant upload the actual picture
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i have a landscape so it mirrors quite nicely
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: work
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: depends on the wallpaper
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: if i'm lucky, i manage to find wallpapers of correct-ish aspect ratio and size
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: You need to make it so that the picture fades up over the windows now and again to remind you that it's there
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: :P
#cs-york < Alan> Haegin: i have screenshot for you...
Jalada hey
Jalada quick advice seek
Jalada pondering upgrading my linux box to Karmic Koala
Jalada har har
Jalada I know it's out soon anyway
Jalada fresh install or upgrade?
Jalada yeah
Jalada I probably have changed quite a few things when fixing bugs and stuff
Jalada OK
Jalada better start backing up all my configs :P I have a rather...obscure...X configuration that runs across 2 graphics cards
Jalada nah I wont lose a lot
Jalada ubuntu 9.04 atm
Jalada and I dunno
Jalada (do you mean Xorg? :P)
Jalada :)
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: do you still use xmonad?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: the talk started 5 minutes ago, he'll not be about :)
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i'm not in London yet
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: yeah, my eyes are broken, hence why I'm a dumbass
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: FFI is a todo, is it urgent?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, my bank does that, they archive x amount of transactions into 'statements' every so often
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, they're accessed slightly differently for me, but I agree it is a bit silly
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: better today. I had an awesome optimisation idea
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: I was about to offer you the spare room at my house, but then I remembered someone might be living there until December
#cs-york          miket |  Haegin: you can have User_4574's room
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: Also, as BidMod points out, you do know 7th/8th October is in the past right?
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: I was putting m yself in second year with kate
#cs-york          mvalle hello, Haegin
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, and probably not as tasty
#cs-york           miket when is the first hacksoc social
#cs-york           [ICR] x5315: come here so we can organise hacksoc events :P
#cs-york   femorandeira |  Haegin: all the cool kids are using GIT nowadays :-D
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: no, it was "Note that while commas serve to delimit multiple arguments in a function call, these commas are not considered "comma operators." Multiple arguments of a function call may be evaluated in any order, with no sequence points between each other.'"
#cs-york   femorandeira |  Haegin: I was of the same opinion until a few months ago
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: Im sure its not :) I tend to use morning, evening, afternoon depending on mood ;)
#cs-york   femorandeira |  Haegin: the flexibility of branches and commit manipulation was what got me into git
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: Fair, never come across one though, maybe i should switch and move the keys around myself
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: i have
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: it used to be twice every other key
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: your Mum?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: now my hash browns are a lot more painful to eat!
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: i think i have just the shirt for you
#cs-york       User_4574 wee need to get Haegin a vine.
#cs-york  *        [ICR] pokes Haegin and other irssi users
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, iirc it still does have some 32bit apps
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: good idea!
#cs-york        Helzibah Jaehl, BAE Systems, Haegin is there now
#cs-york        Helzibah Jaehl, other people have done C/C++ w/graphics for the awesome train sim, or stuck with a hideous Java monstrosity as Haegin now suffers :P
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, good compsci
#cs-york       mailmerge cheers for the tip Haegin
#cs-york      mailmerge |  Haegin: sorry, just figured DaveX was at Langwith
#cs-york  Couennedousse |  Haegin: thanks, pulseaudio looks like it's so cross-platform that they forgot to port it to mac
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: it gets better after the first bit
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: after the intro
adrianracu hey
adrianracu can i get a flexi day
adrianracu without booking it?
adrianracu oh
adrianracu there's also the meeting
adrianracu lol
#cs-york     jstephenson He was chatting about HackSoc tho
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: ah, fair enough
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: if it does anything this year :P
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yeah, but nobody wants to do anything with it :P
#cs-york    jstephenson |  Haegin: Really nice yeah - bound to be 'cause it's all brand new!
#cs-york    jstephenson |  Haegin: We keep locking ourselves out with the whole keycard access to everywhere thing, which is unforutnate
#cs-york    jstephenson |  Haegin: 'Normal' (ensuite :D)
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, Word is awesome, compared to alternatives
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, what version?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i might be able to now, with another 6 years of development
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: You're implying they actually do stop fucking themselves, have you seen their business practices? ;)
#cs-york           x5315 http://hacksoc.org/
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: that's what x5315 knows him as :p
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: umm, that's Gackt.
jensraaby some pretty cool SFFS photos from one of my photoSoc comrades - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ratamatatta/page2/
#cs-york           [ICR] That would be cool. Need to sort out some hackSoc stuff
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: really, have they really removed functionality?
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: yeah, but GDM had the config ability to do it
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: with Slim, I think I can run it twice to get the same functionality
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: people have some going spare now
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: SLiM on Ubuntu Karmic - help :(
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: or FF
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: really? hmm
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: must be something wrong with my apt mirror
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: your google talk status says "slepping"
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: to spawn 2 X servrs
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: because I have 2 garphics cards, and 2 monitor
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: because I COULD with fucking GDM
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: again...GDM could do this fine, I already have the 2 config files
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: I used to have 3

#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, are you planning a York trip at any point?
foalys_apprentice thanks
foalys_apprentice ok
foalys_apprentice struggling to get Slim to allow synergy for some reason
foalys_apprentice fine once I'm logged in
foalys_apprentice oh
foalys_apprentice Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 
foalys_apprentice an auth thing?
foalys_apprentice Even though I'm running synergy as root lmao
foalys_apprentice it's usually fine
foalys_apprentice fine once I login
foalys_apprentice any way of finding out what X display SLiM runs as?
foalys_apprentice 'cos maybe it's just not :0
foalys_apprentice *: 0
foalys_apprentice hmm
foalys_apprentice /usr/bin/X11/X -nolisten tcp -auth /var/run/slim.auth vt07
foalys_apprentice vt07, how odd
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: yah, I was thinking that
foalys_apprentice really? doesn't that normally say :0
foalys_apprentice *: 0
foalys_apprentice or :1
foalys_apprentice yeah, I know
foalys_apprentice but normally when running 'X' you specify the display
foalys_apprentice like
foalys_apprentice X -nolisten TCP :0
foalys_apprentice or X -nolisten tcp :1
foalys_apprentice think I'm gonna have to go back to GDM
foalys_apprentice :P
foalys_apprentice I know GDM
foalys_apprentice even if it does suck now
foalys_apprentice see, GDM, synergy works straight away
foalys_apprentice :P
foalys_apprentice right
foalys_apprentice that's better
foalys_apprentice now to fix xmobar :P
foalys_apprentice there
foalys_apprentice it's in the repo
foalys_apprentice but the repo must be an old version because it didn't like my config
foalys_apprentice so I compiled it
foalys_apprentice I really like it
foalys_apprentice gives you a little bar across the top saying the title of the program you're on, the workspaces visible on your monitor(s) and what other workspaces have stuff in. Also can show memory, cpu, date, window layout config
foalys_apprentice well, all of it is optional
foalys_apprentice it's very slim
foalys_apprentice 13px high?
foalys_apprentice it might be 16px :P I'm not sure
foalys_apprentice the font I'm using is 13px though
foalys_apprentice Config { font = "-*-Fixed-Bold-R-Normal-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
foalys_apprentice        , bgColor = "black"
foalys_apprentice        , fgColor = "grey"
foalys_apprentice        , position = TopW L 1280
foalys_apprentice        , commands = [ Run Cpu ["-L","3","-H","50","--normal","green","--high","red"] 10

foalys_apprentice        }
foalys_apprentice that's my config
foalys_apprentice no, that's in .xmobarrc in my home directory
foalys_apprentice one sec
foalys_apprentice http://slexy.org/view/s2h8lxQtX1
foalys_apprentice that's my xmonad config
#ylug        daeghnao Also Haegin
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: something else you may be able to help with
foalys_apprentice http://slexy.org/view/s2vUQZNGiO
foalys_apprentice ahh
foalys_apprentice yeah
foalys_apprentice I decided my terminals perform fine :p
foalys_apprentice really? :P
foalys_apprentice :P
foalys_apprentice do I believe you? :P
#cs-york          BidMod katwin, [ICR] and me are organising an unofficial CS drinking sesh tomorrow, just to cover hacksoc until it finds it's feet for this term. are you interested?
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: me + work source = lolcry
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: paestbin?
#cs-york          katwin also. are we hacksoc-ing daytime or eveningtime?
foalys_apprentice check that 1280 bit in the config
foalys_apprentice e.g. it might be shifting too far across :P
foalys_apprentice offset
foalys_apprentice try 0
foalys_apprentice and see what happens
#cs-york @           emb /agree Haegin
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, if you're all oppy and cool :P
#cs-york @           emb Alan: dragged Haegin down in the process :( but he seems to be alive?
#cs-york     Tinned_Tuna but you've left x5315 in charge of HackSoc :-(
#cs-york @           emb Tinned_Tuna: this isn't a hacksoc channel, it's coincidence
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, I'm not sure he even noticed :P
#cs-york        Lard1962 Tinned_Tuna: what do you folks do at HackSoc, when and if you meet?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: :P
#cs-york            Alan is there a hacksoc happening?
#cs-york  *          emb wonders if miket will want to do a friday hacksoc
#cs-york         julian- hacksoc?
#cs-york         julian- Did you just say "hacksoc"?
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin, hacksoc !
#cs-york          katwin can we make people not play portal at hacksoc?
#cs-york         julian- Why wouldn't people at hacksoc not want to play Portal?
#cs-york         julian- Portal sounds perfect for hacksoc
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin++
jensraaby http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM_ruBwYGtg
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, hahaha, he has no idea what he's saying :P
#cs-york          katwin night Haegin
#cs-york          BidMod I suggested it as an unofficial one-off that Hacksoc might choose to repeat
#cs-york          BidMod I was just thinking a handful of people rather than a full-blown Hacksoc event
#cs-york          katwin so, like, I guess I will not be at hacksoc till friday
#cs-york          miket |  Haegin: consider yourself om nominated
#cs-york          miket |  Haegin: i've not seen her around
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, it always worked fine for me, so no idea
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah.

#cs-york      blue_rose |  haegin: couldn't stand it, don't think i put enough on, just fell off everywhere
#cs-york     Tinned_Tuna I'm confused by Haegin's massive posts
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, WTF is that?
#cs-york           x5315 it's coming from Haegin
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, im using WPF
#cs-york             emb x5315: yes it did. you have Haegin just like you always did
#ylug        daeghnao So far I've got me and mavez and Haegin and Redgore and Cosmo
#ylug           liam2 I thought Haegin was down is Brissol
hoffish hello
hoffish mostly good
hoffish how's it for you?
hoffish Wales?
hoffish What yo doing there?
hoffish oh ok
hoffish that's nice
hoffish is work still ok?
hoffish oh
hoffish doesn't sound so good- not that socialable really, then
hoffish you haven't found any groups to join or anything like that then? 
hoffish yeah
hoffish not quite so much your scene then
hoffish Yeah
hoffish I've just been doing my usual things
hoffish drama, uni-ness , work etc
hoffish yeah
hoffish I think so
hoffish yeah
hoffish about a chapter a week
hoffish been a little ill this week so haven't got as much done but otherwise it is good
hoffish it is but I've decided not to do it this year 
hoffish just feeling a bit sick and headachey
hoffish not bad enough to be off work, though
hoffish yeah
hoffish it's the easiet thing to do
hoffish just round the corner
hoffish I won't like it so much when its the new school
hoffish yeah until november
hoffish it's not ready
hoffish well, I assume not else we would have
hoffish yeah
hoffish I know
hoffish oh
hoffish what is it?
hoffish nope
hoffish heard of it
hoffish um... Mark is around
hoffish not really sure who else
hoffish haven't seen him for a few weekends- he was ok then, though
hoffish A group of us went to look round savernake, had a BBQ and went to the pub
hoffish oh ok
hoffish you can get lots of time off work, then?
hoffish oh
hoffish fair enough, then
hoffish ou might as well make the most of it
hoffish *you
hoffish how come?
hoffish just the way it is?
hoffish oh, that's a shame
hoffish That would have been good
hoffish So do you still manage to play D&D or is that not happening since you are in Bristol?
hoffish yeah
hoffish it sounds a bit disruptive to your social life
hoffish surely something is better than nothing, though?
hoffish oh
hoffish oh right
hoffish annoying?
hoffish yeah
hoffish how did he meet her then?
hoffish oh right- lol
hoffish so are the cardiff ppl all right?
hoffish i don't really understand how it can be considered dating when you have never met
hoffish how old is he?
hoffish so she is 15? or did you mean she is 20?
hoffish what!
hoffish that is wrong
hoffish I mean sam is 4 years younger than me but he is 18 so it's not such an issue
hoffish but 15!
hoffish oh dear
hoffish i suppose at least they are only talking online in that case
hoffish oh- that bad?
hoffish how's lozzi?
hoffish oh ok
hoffish let you off, then
hoffish oh
hoffish so she is being visited a lot
hoffish yeah, we are... slowly
hoffish he's at uni now in Exter
hoffish Yeah... well, harder
hoffish I still see him every week
hoffish no and email loads
hoffish It's funny, he has  roommate who seems to be exactly your sort of person
hoffish Sci Fi society, D&D , plays Halo... that sort of thing
hoffish it made me chuckle when I found out
hoffish unfortunately Sam isn't so in to that stuff
hoffish I mean unfortunately seems he has to share a room with a guy lke that
hoffish no- we are about equal relaly
hoffish he likes him as a person but doens't have much in common with him
hoffish so, you know, it's ok but not ideal
hoffish yeah
hoffish so you looking forwrad to some more proper socialising in Cardiff?
hoffish no,, not so much
hoffish too expensive
hoffish true
hoffish so you been missing all your York friends?
hoffish not so good
hoffish regretting having a year in industry or is it worth it?
hoffish that's good then
hoffish that's the main thing
hoffish yeah
hoffish I suppose it is
hoffish i'd better go now_ i need to get up else i'll run out of time before work
hoffish i know
hoffish you too
hoffish yeah
hoffish no- I doon't mind
hoffish it didn't feel like that anyway
hoffish yeah ok
hoffish bye :-)

#cs-york    Tinned__Tuna User_4574, was that due to Haegin
#cs-york             emb people back from hacksoc?
red_cap00 hey
#cs-york           BMatt someone at the york open day mentioned hacksoc so I thought I'd check it out
#cs-york           [ICR] BMatt: was the one who told you about hacksoc ginger?
#cs-york   Couennedousse is hacksoc at freshers' fair tomorrow?
hoffish hey
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, because you pay for what you get
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, why dont you get a OpenMoko phone
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yes you do
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, well thats what you get if you want cheap
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, its liek £200 isnt it?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, get it on a contract
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: you see, the iPhone really is the best option
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, but for larger screen, good touch screen, multi-touch, average cpu = £470
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: A grand is over stating it. There's lots of mac kit below that
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: that was what I was assuming. I mean what do you want to develop for it
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, or you could do it in MonoTouch
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, meh
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, then why replace it?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: The Dark Knight, 320GB
jensraaby he's here playing uplink
jensraaby y
jarnie You there?
jensraaby we've got a leg of pork for tomorrow - are you going to be back in time for dinner?
markjohnson1988 rar
jarnie Hey hey.
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: ubuntu
jarnie Have you ever done any map making?
jarnie Hmmm. We wanted to make a map of the ATC for L4D :)
jarnie But none of us have ever done any mapping :(
jarnie I'm downloading the L4D authoring tools now to have a look. Might be a mini-project for this year.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: what if he's using ksh on AIX and only thinks it's Linux!? :p
jarnie Don't suppose you fancy helping out? :)
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Pass... I guess I'm logged in as comprec?
jarnie Super. Might be a multi-person project, otherwise it'll never get done...
#cs-york        daeghnao But yes, I think Haegin's suggestion is the best.  Put it all in the home directory, it'll be fine there.
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: yeah
#cs-york     Tinned_Tuna what Haegin said...
#cs-york           DaveX thanks Haegin
#cs-york           MikeT iMaud: you were not at the freshers event for hacksoc on friday and there was much unhappiness
#cs-york             emb daeghnao, Haegin: do you have ^Tom's number?
david224 hey
david224 are you here, i have a ton of question to ask
david224 hey
red_cap00 hey
red_cap00 i want to be an OP again :(
david224 hey
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: can i be an OP again
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: if i do, you can have my MAcs
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: well, the most important ones
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: if i leave and come back, will this stay?
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: this is a disco, right?
#cs-york           [ICR] This may not be the hacksoc channel, but it does make sense to have an actual hacksoc person op to promote events
#cs-york           MikeT i'm a hacksoc person
#cs-york           MikeT because.. haegin favours me, right?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: :D
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I figured right after I asked
x5315 oh ok
x5315 thanks :)
x5315 i won't really do it
x5315 it's just when i want to change the topic
x5315 tbh, i'd be fine with hop
x5315 but freenode doesn't do that
x5315 yeh
x5315 makes sense
x5315 yey
x5315 cool :)
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: makes sense
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: do you have to get up at 6am?
#cs-york        Sunshard Quote by User_4574: Haegin, while being completely useless, knows his stuff.
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: Comprec is actually good now
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: uuuuuhhhhhhhhh...
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: we just did
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: agreed, i had guessed it was more Homoglyph's fault as you havent been around
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yeah
david224 hey will you be up for talking after 5ish, as i have to go food shopping
david224 cool where you at

x5315 "(notice) You are not authorized to perform this operation."

#cs-york  slugonamission I'm a hacksoc person too :p
x5315 yeh
#cs-york         laser` |  Haegin: Of course
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: um, yeh sure
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: think so, but it's probably just a wrapper over RDP
#cs-york       Baldrick1 Hi Haegin + everyone
#cs-york  *        DaveX thanks Haegin for working on the freshers guide
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: that and Verona

#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: youve done much to increase my nixfu
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: that sounds ominous. That sounds like you have some obscure extra thing to get RSS and put it into a watched folder and so on
david224 hey how was the train
david224 ok
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: LAWL!?

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: Erm, no.
jarnie You there?
jarnie I have literally done the impossible. I have recreated...the ATC!
jarnie To scale!
jarnie With one floor, no textures, no doors, no windows! I emailed you source pics, in case you're serious about trying to do this.
jarnie Looks like the H is slightly offset, but figured we could get away with it square :)
jarnie Sure. I'm thinking it's probably going to be a long-term project :)
jensraaby http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2009/10/19/8windows-7-the-licensing-mess-continues/
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: it's been so long since I've been at york that I have no idea where that is
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i dunno
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: it memory leaks like a bastard, whereas chrome is designed to consume all available resources
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin, I am indeed a mathmo
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Heh, Bristol is further, I think, but has a better train connection.
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: nope
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: neither does oss4
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: at which point I gave up, cos I was meant to be working, not trying to play Infected Mushroom
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: so still not ready for the average user, then
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: yeah, but the average linux user is ready for 24 hour Rockstar fueled config file hackfests
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: that'd be the point where I'd start looking for employment elsewhere
adrianracu Robert Cazaciuc
adrianracu http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/20/macbook-goes-unibody-available-today/
adrianracu tell jens
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: think so
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I hate ripping with my MBP, though I guess I could get the drive..
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
david224 hey any new on the money
#cs-york       User_4574 is Haegin or any other irssi-enlightened person around
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: or verdana :p
#cs-york        LordRam |  Haegin, thanks, I've found it :) I hope they've one of those wifi adapters...
#cs-york        LordRam |  Haegin, thanks :)
#cs-york  slugonamission 1.104 to you Haegin
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: or, you can get a life :)
#netbeans         Candle |  Haegin: clean build, any compile errors?
#netbeans @    ShelLuser |  Haegin: how did you assign the library ?
#netbeans @    ShelLuser |  Haegin: did you use the library manager or did you merely right click the library tab and selected "add zip/jar" or such ?
#netbeans @    ShelLuser |  Haegin: Sure, but how did you add the library to the manager?
#netbeans         Candle |  Haegin: what happens when you use the command line to compile and run it?
#netbeans @    ShelLuser |  Haegin: its usually easier to use the library manager (tools -> libraries) because then you can also add javadoc and source codes from the library.
#netbeans @    ShelLuser |  Haegin: although this should also work out.
#netbeans @    ShelLuser |  Haegin: when you collapse your project's library folder, does it show the jarfile?  And can you also open that ?
#netbeans @    ShelLuser |  Haegin: what NB version are you using ?
#netbeans         Candle |  Haegin: win+r, type 'cmd', enter, type 'java -version', if you get a command not found, then you have a %PATH% problem, then try 'javac -version' same again re: %PATH%.
adrianracu u still at work?
jarnie hey, get a chance to look at the new map I sent Jason?

#cs-york           MikeT hacksoc is shit anyway
Homoglyph I may actually start using zsh
Homoglyph Not for any of your re3asons, just because getting prompts to work is nicer than in bash...
Homoglyph You can use altchar instead of the horrible bash escapes.
jarnie You there?
jarnie Fancy a bit of survival mode?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: That's the Linux way.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Why?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Hmm, I've found their upload speeds pretty good.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'm terms of the quickest transfer, something like Skype might work, with DB it will be a case of waiting for it to be uploaded before it can be downloaded, though once it's there the download should be nice and speedy.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'm confuzzled.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Not sure how it'd be possible to be honest, in terms of their versioning tech.
jarnie Or, mind starting the dedicated server you have? Don't seem to be able to run it on mine, since installed Windows 7...
jarnie Cheers
jarnie Oh
jarnie Can you do hamachi at the same time? :)

david224 hey how thinks
david224 ok so,
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: I'm just gonna go with your mum
red_cap00 you don't think that's too far?
red_cap00 lis0r
red_cap00 ‣
red_cap00 to be fair
red_cap00 22:47
red_cap00 
red_cap00 lis0r
red_cap00 ‣
red_cap00 she *did* die of a farting disease
red_cap00 22:48
red_cap00 
red_cap00 Maud
red_cap00 ‣
red_cap00 bowel cancer is not really a "farting disease"
red_cap00 22:48
red_cap00 
red_cap00 lis0r
red_cap00 ‣
red_cap00 look, she totally would have farted if it weren't for the gas getting collected in a bag
red_cap00 other people might not
red_cap00 especially regarding some of the other comments
red_cap00 this went a bit far
red_cap00 and yes
red_cap00 i got offended
red_cap00 ok
red_cap00 especially with toni's mum dying recently
red_cap00 she died of bowel complications
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: I think the real frosting on the cake is that not did Russia really build a doomsday device, but they a) did so after it came out and b) didn't tell anyone about it
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin, my mother worked it out in the first 2 mins of the film whilst never seeing it
User_4574 hi
User_4574 how do?#
User_4574 aye good ta
User_4574 it's been bugging me and chris for far too long now
User_4574 what's the deal with the comprec website?
User_4574 comprec.org is registered with 123-reg, and supposedly forwards to ~elec37, but both sites are different
User_4574 and comprec.org is much newer
User_4574 ooh ok, which is that?
User_4574 ty
User_4574 odd, no luck
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yep
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Swayed to nausea perhaps.
User_4574 elec37/e4osiste
User_4574 yup
User_4574 comprec.org.uk
User_4574 yeah
User_4574 i always forget the uk
User_4574 yes
User_4574 aah ok
User_4574 makes sense
User_4574 right ok
User_4574 so how can we edit the site to update etc?
User_4574 you gave us ftp details?
User_4574 right ok
User_4574 thanks
User_4574 ok, what happens to info@comprec.org.uk emails?
User_4574 no, they dont
User_4574 xyzzy got put down
User_4574 we backed up and started over with a clean install of jaunty to tidy up a few things
User_4574 comprec is now totally different
User_4574 right ok
User_4574 viki is it's replacement
User_4574 you mean, as in the office pc's?
User_4574 lol, im not surprised
User_4574 net booting? we had netbooting? i know we do now cause i set it up, but we did?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: no.
User_4574 we have ubuntu 9.04 install netbooting
User_4574 but problem is, it's not OEM
User_4574 that's cool, not oem, but cool
User_4574 we have it so we install, then click a link and it does stuff so the end user can set username/password/location etc
User_4574 that kind of oem
User_4574 right
User_4574 the netboot installer i have doesnt have as many options as the livecd
User_4574 i have it so it's essentially just cdless, not headless
User_4574 possibly not
User_4574 i think i just did /home/comprec
User_4574 lol
User_4574 i'll check
User_4574 but i'll have to go in to do it]
User_4574 it's all on a backup drive, which will go in mordor, which isnt set up yet

#cs-york  *         Alan throws things at Haegin's net connection
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: pretty sure that's not possible..
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: that expensive? :|
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: what speed DDR2?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: erm, php.net/pdo?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: named arguments? for mysql?
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: I mean the headphones themselfs, I always slip with the iron at some point or come in at an odd angle and melt them
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: their not amazing but their mine and I love them :)
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: maybe, I'll check the kitchen out to see if its do able, otherwise ill email the cs dept
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: Langwith
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: I can solder :P I just bother paying much attention
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: I managed to fix that by cleaning the tip till it was shiny again, however, it melted :)
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: a nail-file worked rather well but I guess I shouldn't have used copper-flux on it afterwards
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: like I said it melted
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: wasnt being serious :) but it looks cool but Id likely get bored pretty quickly
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: living the dream I see
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin: yeah you do
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Is that a game of "find the config file"?
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: "Vi: The Last Configuration Of Sendmail.cf" is not a computer game
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: but you win by dding /dev/zero over your boot device
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: No, that's this year. I'm applying for next year.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I think that may be anatomically problematic.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Er?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: There's freeleech on all horror films = easy ratio
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Alien
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: the lion king
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: According to the internets, you want psycho, the Shining, The Thing, The Exorcist, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Birds, Evil Dead 2 and Misery.
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: It should be out there somewhere.  It's the original The Eye, from 2002.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Apple have dropped ZFS development over licensing issues.
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: SD generally
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Apparently so.
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Not actually that old... I think it's 2005
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Wrong
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, apparnetly it is, according to my RSS feeds earlier
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: oh
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: honestly, this isn't abuse
#cs-york           x5315  /kick Haegin
#cs-york  * Couennedouss slaps Haegin around a bit with a TCL-powered popup
#cs-york             emb DaveX: in mitigation, you said what you did right after Haegin's response.
#cs-york        daeghnao OMG it's Haegin

#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Gena is thinking 3 days either side.
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Sure, why not?  Although I only have one set of keys, and I don't think it splits 3 ways.
#cs-york          lis1r |  Haegin: that's ok, they were only goths anyway

david224 ok  i will still be here
david224  On friday you get in at 1924, i was wondering if you what to go to a japeness noodle bar called wagamama
david224 next question do you want the air mattress or thin futon
david224 or my bed
david224 yes unless you want to sleep under a thin blanket
david224 ko
david224 ok
david224 well the futon looks thinish, and the air matress is alright as long as it stays inflated and you sleep in the middle
david224 so the choose is yours
david224 just need to know if a have to blow up the bed on friday
david224 hey
david224 //nudge
david224 ok
david224  cool that fine
david224 lol is there any in london you want to go
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin_: I think the issue is with the ease of setting it up
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin_: LOL
david224 I was thinking the science mesimum as it is free entry, and maybe look around the wallice and gromit exerbissen that £9 each
david224 or we there is the national history musimun
david224 or the tate modden
david224 or the imperral war mesimum
david224 but i am not sure that one is free
david224 so there are a few ideas
david224 to start
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin_, do you mean each nick is differently coloured or all nicks are a seperate distinct colour?
david224 but again the choose is yours
david224 so how far has he got in half life
david224 ok that cool i hope you would say that one
#cs-york          Maud_ |  Haegin_: elf isn't in the list and none of them have randomly coloured nicks
david224 so how he doing
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin_: fuck off, that's a retarded view point
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin_: see my comment above about investment
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin_, I really think it depends
david224 i do not know
david224 possable
x5315 hey
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin_:++
x5315 so…
x5315 i hear that lis0r just made a reference to killing julian's dead dad?
david224 well they are both free enter
x5315 interesting, eh.
x5315 ah ok
x5315 well, i'm being told this by proxy
x5315 since i now ignore lis0r
david224 yeah it is next to elephant
david224 and castle
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin_, I haven't got much experience with small projects, but I would not do that
x5315 yeh
david224 Also i agree that season 3 of my name earl is awful
x5315 it's almost like i made this point a few weeks ago…
x5315 mmm
david224 yeah just that you mention it
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin_: but we don't
david224 lol
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin_: you ever heard of the turing test?
david224 but does the last epersoide make sense
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: Doesn't that scupper the "fork it" meme?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: BS, cf. the whole con kolivas saga.
david224 because stargate ad got canceled  and make very little  sense 
emb ohai
emb cheers
emb no luck. bleh
david224 ok
emb hmm justasec
emb do I need to be sourcing filetype.vim from anywhere?
#cs-york  Couennedousse |  Haegin_: just replace purple with a flashing rainbow-cycle
x5315 it was ICR
david224 also i found a copy of the count of montecrito
x5315 because he knows julian
x5315 i'd rather prefer if you didn't mention it by name
x5315 and yeh...
x5315 from some of the people i've been talking to
x5315 lis0r's a bit grinding
x5315 mmm
x5315 i think it's better if you leave it for a bit
x5315 maybe she'll calm down or something :S
david224 the remake film,  and i also have v for vedetta the book if you want them
david224 to borrow it
david224 i will see you at  on friday at the station at 7.21

#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin_: i can do what?
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin_: i can?
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin_: not sure if you can do that in Adium
#cs-york @        Jalada like Haegin_ said, any half-decent IRC client should let you ignore that :P
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin_: hao
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, yea
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin_: I don't know how to do any of this :[
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin_: Shh :[ no
#cs-york     Jalada_FUN |  Haegin_: I managed to set up NAT on x5315's Powerbook over Firewire before?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin_: No idea - it's at home in London
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: hopefully.
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, i disagree with the latex bit, if people want to use it, then they will learn it
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin_: I know, it's a sarcastic comment from the depths of the past
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, optionally
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, JJ says the practical for it is optional
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: graphviz would be epic useful for tons of things if the course could assume you knew it
#cs-york     Jalada_FUN |  Haegin_: oh cool...I should look into that for my project
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, lectures are optional, and theres no Word practical
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: LyX? :/
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, i've still done the Latex stuff, just incase i ever need to use it
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, no
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, well yes
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: wut, git's epic straightforward =/
#cs-york    Jalada_CSCR |  Haegin_: I think someone shut it off anyway :P
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin_: Yeah it is :D
#cs-york @        Jalada I remember Haegin_ sharing stuff over HTTP :P
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin_: Where did you get that value?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin_: i "dock" my laptop
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin_: more mice?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin_: http://hosting.nitescifi.com/upload/1256414467.JPG
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin_: yeh, it's my Apple LED Cinema Display
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_, not really :(
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_, OH, wrong thread of discussion :)
#cs-york          BidMod and yes, Haegin_, sort of - I don't know what they call it themselves.
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin_: Theres a whole floor they will do on the day before me
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin_, I have nightmares about that happening.
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin_, Without, I've scared the postment often enough, builders don't bother me.
#cs-york         sveiss |  Haegin_: you're cool like that?
#cs-york         sveiss |  Haegin: I wasn't talking to you... I was referring to the cool guy with the underscore
#cs-york          Maud_ |  Haegin: you can definitely plug it into any old monitor with an adapter
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: but the issue isn't about functionality
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: bollocks, quite frankly
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: if you have vi, you have head, tail, cat and echo
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: some people like pain - it doesn't mean it's not painful
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: no
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: so it's biggest feature is a lack of a scrollball?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: just come over
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: tbh, i doubt it'd work with linux
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh, it's gone
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: It fell down the back of a sofa.
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Only if you give one to me.
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: get two Apple LED cinema displays
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, no i said important
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin, ?
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: I disappeared because I was adjusting my irssi config / testing the autorun of it :P
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: that app needs a kick up the ass :(
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: unfortunately, it's expensive to debug :|
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: so far, it's been the "6574% bug" and "0% bug" and "loses progress halfway through bug"
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin Possible corruption of large files with ext4 filesystem
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, no probs, i was looking to migrate my server to it, once linode put a disk image up for it
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i torrented it too

#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: no
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing ignore the first bit, just do the advanced config onwards
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: true, but it's much cooler.
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yeah, my old setup was to seperate the adapters, PXE load the installer, then quickly kill it and re-bridge the adapters
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, ifconfig was the one i was looking for, but thanks
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Remind me why we had the box at all rather than just connecting the networking to the confnet?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i want a way that does it outside of application level
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: You had a config file all set up for that last year, is it hanging about somewhere still?  In fact, did I take a copy?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Ubuntu installed, both network cards set up, plugged in to PS3
#cs-york     prettygreat Aw haegin aten't there :(

#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, could you have it sent to work, or might it end up as a controlled explosion? or is it just not allowed?
#cs-york   prettygreat_ |  Haegin: Would a router work?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, when I was in there the other day they didn't have crossovers
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: is that free as in, free speech?

#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, I guess there are some exceptions, since everyone's mind is different
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: I assume so
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: the weekend just gone

#ylug       daeghnao |  Haegin: I have loads of blanks spare already, I think we'll be OK.
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, when are you in York? (tangent from other conversation - looking at topic & thinking event)
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Read, but limit it and do a muscle relaxing afterwards.
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Mmm, there's a relaxation technique of tensing and relaxing muscles in a set pattern.
#cs-york        Mod-Bid |  Haegin, sorry, but I'm in the quiet block, so better not.
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: It's for properly relaxing.  I can show you when you get here.
#cs-york        Mod-Bid |  Haegin, put a bookmark in where you want to stop, and then use self discipline. also, I have only one plug.
#cs-york         Mod-Bid another tangent: Haegin, when you were at Comprec, did you ever work with the Viglen machines with the Savage4 GFX cards?
#cs-york       Elsington hacksoc fucking sucked :( is it any better now?
#cs-york  tommylommykins I thought you said hacksoc only came into being ~2 years ago

#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: ipcop has no 802.11x on it, and getting it on it is likely to be a pain.

nessieliberation_ hi
blore hi Harry
blore You wanna meet up - I'm gonna need to know where you are staying....
#cs-york          BidMod morning Haegin
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, how long you where for?
blore After work
blore But I need to know WHERE
blore Where's that?!
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Well done on the getting up in the morning.
daeghnao There is oats, puffed rice, eggs.
blore This info is quite important
blore Unless you wanna just meet me in town - say 6pm-ish
blore But I'll still need a where on that
blore Ok, so not town
blore Infact you come here
blore Yes
blore You know where Ioko is?
blore If not I can meet you on Campus, say Derwent bar
blore Probably prevent you standing out in whatever cold is happening
blore Is that ok?
blore I need to know which you wanna do Harry
blore I don't mind
blore But I would like a choice
blore Otherwise I'm just guessing where you are
blore Fine - see you 17:40ish
blore We can go to town or eat up at the Charles
blore Or anywhere in between - I got plenty $$$
blore Yeah - Charles is not my scene really
blore We could goto a Chinese if you like
blore depends what time you have
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Yes.  Use wooden implements.
blore Dave with you?
blore ah ok
blore anyone else?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Oh that's a great idea
blore no
blore Sorry
blore I don't
blore Who's Gena?
blore great
blore background?
blore She's a Dave clone
blore lol
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: "Alma: can you get me a meeting please, either london or Warrington,
blore Me
blore erm
blore 2005 and 2006
blore yeah
blore ha ha ha - you should see the test results on the new ATi/NVidia stuff
blore omg
blore ATi just released the 5870
blore NVidia just released the Mars
blore The 5870 uses 300W less power and is better in 4/5 of the tested games compared to TWO Mars cards in Quad-SLI
blore There is one other difference...
blore ...the 5870 costs just over £300...
blore ...two Mars cards in that setup cost over £2,000
blore It unsurprisingly got 17% for value in the Custom PC review
blore NVidia have to stop this rot
blore They've barely caught up with the card I have and ATi have just upgraded it to this card
blore This story sound familar?
blore AMD and Intel...
blore Phenoms just approaching about a Q9300 standard and then i7 comes out
blore That power issue alone is unacceptable
blore 300W!
blore That's not 300W consumed, that's 300W more than the ATi card
blore but yeah - their CPUs are taking a beating
blore You know what you get for 300W alone?
nessieliberation_ are you still in york?
blore You get my PC running most apps including games - twice
blore Oh - and did I mention the Mars cards occupy 2 3-unit spaces in your PC?
daeghnao Heh.
daeghnao The ones to use are the ones on the shelf of neatly-stacked unlabelled disks, from the piles at the back left.
daeghnao They should all be blank, 2/80/18, FAT12
daeghnao Please either return them in such a state to the neat pile, or put them in the large collection of assorted stacks on the desk, when finished.
daeghnao Unless you want to keep the disk.
daeghnao In which case, there are some labels somewhere.
daeghnao Probably in the top crate on the landing.
#cs-york             emb facepalm @ hackSoc email

emb you should have it in chair@
emb know if anyone intends to run atm?
emb he's not about :(
emb did the playpen get hax'd from the face of the planet afayk?
emb It'll make writing a constitution hella easier ??
emb tbh, lack of playpen = we could have the WTFPL as our constitution, since the dept probably won't care

blore 2. A statement saying how P35 is better than X48
blore 3. A motherboard review - my board heads the field by 15% over nearest rival
#cs-york          BidMod prettygreat, you should have come to our social and met Haegin :)

#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: what was your RAM?
blore a bit of work with a soldering iron and that card'll work great
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: oh? is there any way to prove that it's the RAM?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: thing is, it seems that this problem NEVER presents before a suspend/resume cycle...
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, apart from that ;P

#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: are you using Twitter again?
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: basically, it's a way of grouping your followers, either publically or privately so that you can view just those people's tweets easily.
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: ok, so now, if you only wanted to see tweets from CS-york people, you could
#cs-york  *          emb throws code-points at Haegin
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: you can have some of the marscapone I shouldn't have eaten x.x
#cs-york          BidMod has there been a Windows-bashing conversation the complete time I've not been here? they last comment before I left was: [15:06] <Haegin> we don't need to attempt to humiliate you, your choice of OS does that for us.
#cs-york             emb mostly Haegin hackintoshing
#cs-york          BidMod presumably, there was a part when Haegin talked about something else, since he only mostly hackintoshed
#cs-york   Sparkesinator emb,  from the 2 comments i've seen from Haegin, and MikeT i would be correct
david224 hey it has just finished and it is awfulll,  there is no really picture it is just a bocky mess
#cs-york  Couennedousse |  Haegin: I doubt it
#cs-york  *          emb should choose a better name for her hacksoc blog and use it again
#cs-york          BidMod just floating a possible social idea, maybe for mid-week 7. does anyone fancy a small Hacksoc bar-crawl?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, the original idea was that it would be a ziggys night, because people could go from the Acorn to the Nag's to get tanked up, with everyone else going to the Maltings, but I don't know how popular the idea is (yet)
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: believe it or not, every such event I've been to with any given society gets massively holier than thou on you for not progressing to the next place, be it town or a club. and that includes hacksoc :/
#cs-york          BidMod I've tended not to find that with Hacksoc,
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: from someone who was sober, I beg to differ.
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, yup
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: no need to ask the dictator, all dept students get a vote
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: As I said, if I do, you do
#cs-york          BidMod I'm thinking back to last year, as Haegin points out it was JJ, and I think he'd be completely unbiased, but I don't know if he'd do it again
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: He's a perfectly competent lecturer and academic. None of this is academic :)
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: with every respect, no.
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, please tell me you're not torrenting something available on the iPlayer?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, do you still have the Alcuin Voting System stuff i sent you?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, you know you can download straight from BBC?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, I'm not certain it works like that...
#cs-york          BidMod it's kind of like Haegin's debate that smoking is bad for you, against the smokers
#cs-york          BidMod in the same way Haegin's argument consisted of "It kills you, you know"
david224 hay
david224 hey
david224 well i want to try and rip some of my better film so i do not  need to bring them with me, at the moment i am try with a dvd, of daredevil

#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Apple TV is Apple's answer to Microsoft's MCE Extenders.
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: that sound quite environment specific. Which environment?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: what GUI framework would that be then?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: not sure. Try both on a big image and see which wins?
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Suggestions?
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: just cause you know Vim, get over it :p
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I don't disagree
#cs-york  *        MikeT hits Haegin with the analogy stick
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: nope. But pretty much any recent IRC client extends the origional IRC protocol. mIRC documented their extensions, made them a standards extension and most clients use them.
#cs-york           [ICR] tommylommykins: Haegin did a similar joke a few days ago
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin, im just quoting, but your probably right
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: there are 39 users!

#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, Visual Studio
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin: you should give up. there's no point. switch degrees!
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: I get what you mean
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: it's User_4574, i don't think it counts as collusion
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: sure, i'll meet you in the charles
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, neither is IE

#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin said UPS delivered to him at around 3pm once
blore d'Oh
blore Difference is yours is full of NVidia rubbish
#cs-york       blue_rose No Haegin say hello to BidMod
#cs-york          BidMod hi Haegin
#cs-york             emb /prod Haegin
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: It's not the compilers that are tricky, it's the CPUs they have to target ;)
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: guess what? I'm back on Jaunty!
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: Karmic was just too fucking buggy for me :(
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: well the worst thing was random IO lockups which sometimes required a hard reboot, sometimes just required me to wait...
#cs-york            Alan how abotu that one Haegin
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: nope
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: the other trace i have is extremely similar, but for a python process...
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: it's gone 4pm, your knowledge of UPS delivery fails! :(
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: in fact, the biggest similarities are the memory addressess
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: with virtual memory, how would you even go about doing that?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: wouldn't that still segfault?
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: i think jalada attempting to carry his new one means that he will shortly be requiring a cup of tea to recover leaving ample time to nick both....
#cs-york       User_4574 ping Haegin
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: you around?
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: yay
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: did that too
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: interesting place to put it...
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i meant putting it in rc.local...
#cs-york       TheHatMan Am I now supreme overlord of HackSoc?
#cs-york       blue_rose Question: Does the hacksoc committee actually do anything?
#cs-york             emb [ICR]: hacksoc email accounts
#cs-york             emb will/has haegin passed it all to you so you can reset it?
#cs-york             emb also, new hacksoc people, gimme amazing wiki now kthx
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: hacksoc's the closest thing to a concerted student effort at anything
#cs-york          BidMod thanks, Haegin
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: sure, but it's not the server that's a problem

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: What?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: notwithstanding the fact that Go is completely inappropriate and has a really strange idea of what "system level" means, sure :/
redcap00 hey
#cs-york           DaveX we need a hacksoc cake day
redcap00 Mike was looking to upgrade the wordpress thing on hacksoc
redcap00 but he doesn't know the admin password for it
redcap00 ok
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: well yes :P hence 'function'al :D
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin: by my shittyness at cs?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, we had 17 in first year :P
[ICR] Can has passwords emailed pls
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: call/cc is completely unneccesary :p
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: nothing you care about :p
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: It takes a snapshot of the current program state and passes it to a function. It's *almost* like setjmp/longjmp in C
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: set/longjmp is pretty esoteric anyway :p
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, well, I can program now, and Haskell is making sense
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: erm, *what*?
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: actually doesnt it count in numbers, not #'s
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: haha oh dear
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I meant format really. What are you after? A skeleton of a project to fill in?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: so a coordinated thing that lots of people do together?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: will think about it
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, tommylommykins talking at 16,43
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: !!!
Jalada well, that didn't go well
Jalada I hope blue_rose is OK
Jalada should've just started kicking
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: haha took your time
Jalada she's not on the network
Jalada already tried that
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, that's pretty awesome
#cs-york           MikeT TIME TO BREAK HACKSOC BLOGS
jensraaby Mike Tomasello changed the name of the group "Hacksoc" to "hackSoc".
jensraaby !!!!!!!
jensraaby Apple fanboys are taking over
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: that's what nice languages are for :D
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i could do with one of those moments right now
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: http://code.google.com/p/noop/
blue_rose hellos
blue_rose Yeah Jalada was saying that not too long ago
blue_rose Thats what I was hoping
blue_rose Really? Jeeze
blue_rose I don't really do any hardware as far as I know
jensraaby http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2009/11/18/flash-10-1-developing-for-desktop-and-device/
blue_rose Yeah I'm pretty sure we do java
blue_rose Meh I can't sleep in these halls anyway
blue_rose But thankies
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: request for clarification, what do you mean?
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: isn't procedural how normal people write code?
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: so, yes.
#cs-york       m0nkfish |  Haegin if you are talking about "worthwhile to teach" then why choose a language that NOBODY uses or cares about
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: yeh, i can go with that
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: some crazy people have implemented them in ruby and scala
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: we learnt about recursion, immutability, equivalence...what did we miss from FP?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: maybe. how much does FUN spend on ADTs and laziness?
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin: actually, in OO, data types are functions more often than in FP
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: you can't execute a function either, notionally
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: evaluating a function returns a function
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: no, a function is a value just like anything else
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: try working through FUN and looking at currying. that might make what I'm saying seem more sensical
#cs-york       m0nkfish |  Haegin: it's in the works?
[ICR] Hey
[ICR] wtf is http://lists.hacksoc.org/admindb.cgi/committee-hacksoc.org and whats the password?
#cs-york            ^Tom nope: 22:37:21 <m0nkfish       > Haegin: it's in the works?
david224 hey  what time is your train due in so i can work out where to meet
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: not afaik. There's a sample run on the module page
#cs-york  *          emb arms Haegin's arms in the arm with an arm
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, link?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, whats that got to do with it?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, ohhh i didnt see the chromeOS bit
david224 hey
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, they are finishing this series
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: what's the other show that's cancelled that you watch then?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: It's like Linux - "free if your time costs nothing" ;)
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: It's at work. On work time :p Just a case of whether I could be doing more useful / interesting things. Idk how much I care about Perl
#cs-york          iMaud |  Haegin: Why it sucked then
#cs-york          iMaud |  Haegin: HAHAHA
#cs-york           [ICR] We're looking to hire the James CR for a hackSoc event, but only James students can do so
#cs-york     Jalada_FSS |  Haegin: did you see the pics of it on Facebook?
#cs-york          BidMod [ICR]: Alex is in James, but is not interested in Hacksoc
#cs-york             emb BidMod: technically a James student can't even book it for hackSoc iirc, so I doubt having a disinterested one do it makes a difference ;p
#cs-york           [ICR] Basically we need a venue for a hackSoc film night
#cs-york     Jalada_FSS |  Haegin: ah
#cs-york         [ICR]1 |  Haegin: well aparently you'd have to be there for the event
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: lol
BidMod who is socs643?
BidMod is that Hacksoc?
BidMod never heard of them....
BidMod :P
BidMod I might ask the information centre if we can get an account, even though we aren't YUSU
BidMod ah yes - I remember now :)
BidMod I'll ask the rest of the committe, but thanks :D
#cs-york             emb also this channel isn't #hacksoc :/
#cs-york          BidMod for the time being, I'll no book anything for Tuesday - I'll try and get a Hacksoc account on Planon - but we have a backup for if we can't  :)
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: is there anything you've become dramatically more familiar with in the first months of your placement that you'd want to contribute?
#cs-york      Pola_bear |  Haegin: you coming to reading tongiht?
adrianracu did u use my sl dvd?
#cs-york          BidMod oh right - I was beginning to think you meant either Hacksoc or DOI
#cs-york @        Jalada and your name is Haegin
jarnie oi
BidMod would you mind resending the socs details for Lazerus for the room booking? Opera on the CS systems doesn't keep a scrollback :(
nessieliberation_ hi
#cs-york          BidMod I considered running for a Hacksoc post last year, but having had so many plans fall through in the past I didn't really think it was worth the effort, but now I'm please to be here
#cs-york       User_4574 nn Haegin
BidMod thanks :)
#cs-york              x_ except hacksoc
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: OSX has that too ;)
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: spotlight makes them look like primitive tools from the 70s - hth
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: is there not a decent numeric library in the Java stdlib?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: 90% of time, the people who want to go are already drunk and not being as casually pursuasive as they think they are :p
#cs-york  *     Helzibah agrees with Haegin 
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: huh? :S
emb sigh, sorry for exploding.
emb :)
emb hackSoc are doing a pudding party. that sounds lulzywin
emb idk when
emb mm. CompSoc + hackSoc coexisting would be best, imho
emb kinda like YUSU LGBT vs Social
emb mayhaps
emb kks
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I was wondering about that
#cs-york      blue-rose |  Haegin: even just plain action games are better than most FPS
#cs-york @         x5315 hai Haegin
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: it's not just spelling correction
#cs-york           MikeT yeah, see. Haegin is clever too!
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin is a total idiot
david224 hey

#cs-york          BidMod not all of them ... we did discuss it - one is probably going to get it, when Haegin gets around to it
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: make that permanent, cheers?
david224 did they really write golden brow
david224 ok can you down load lunca coil they sound intressting
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, what are you planning?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, just login from a different client using a different nick?
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin, Jalada and I have ops because we always did. Divine right of geeks or sth
#cs-york           MikeT i don't think hacksoc needs ops. i think hacksoc should have an op'd bot that can set the topic :p
david224 ok airboure is a deffineate
#cs-york          BidMod I think Haegin is working on that
david224 i will listern to some lacuna coil and descide if it is worth it,  and you listern to some trivium and deside if you want to come and join me, but i will be planning to see it in oxford when it is on a sat
david224 ok

#cs-york @           emb I think Haegin kicked me after

#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: hai
x5315 but, at one point
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin: indeed
x5315 stewberry was walling drug talk
#cs-york  stewberry_sauc aye Haegin
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: I only have Comalies
x5315 which should go in a pastebin if anything
david224 have been listrening to lacuna coil, there a bit more rock/ophera so you might like them and it could be a good night out
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: "Lacuna Coil" and "Comalies" are probably the best to go for.

#cs-york        Helzibah although it's really annoying when I'm talking to Haegin and it tab-completes my name
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, thanks, you should add Sunshard too :)
#cs-york      ^Helzibah |  ^Haegin, I think I lost the first round :P
#cs-york            emb |  ^Haegin: That's ok, rhinos are immune to magic
#cs-york         ^DaveX |  ^Haegin: who have you been chatting up?
#cs-york  *          emb nominates ^Haegin to spend more time on bash.org
x5315 do it
x5315 i think this would be a good situation to show that i'm still opable :p
x5315 did you +b me?
#cs-york  * ^tommylommyk steals Haegin's hat :D
#cs-york          x5315 |  ^Haegin: that was a reference?
#cs-york   ^Tinned_Tuna| Sorry |Haegin :-p
#cs-york  ^Tinned_Tuna| |  |Haegin: it's quite easy isn't it?
#cs-york  ^Tinned_Tuna| |  |Haegin: exactly what're you trying to do?
#cs-york  ^Tinned_Tuna| |  |Haegin : so, how're you planning to do it?
#cs-york  ^Tinned_Tuna| |  |Haegin: any luck with that Idea?
#cs-york        daeghnao Is the | that ^Tinned_Tuna| is standing on the same as the | that |Haegin is wearing?
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin^: I basically just want something like how itunes shares it's library only with moar video support
#cs-york  ^Tinned_Tuna| |  Haegin^: you don't have to use your finger ;-)
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin^: Tried the Alaska skin?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, no problem, help yourself to breakfast
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, it depends on the program doesnt it?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, looks ok but samsung do better for less i think
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: have done, I want to know the exact spec they're using so that I understand what it takes to emulate it
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: we *did* have 8 of them until the server room got rained on
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin_: you've got a little something trailing there...
#mplayer          cbreak seems fairly obvious Haegin.
#mplayer        ps-auxw |  Haegin: Depending on where you want to play your encoded files, you might want to take a look at using x264 for better quality.
[B]randon /server cable.sharetheremote.org switch servers please

david224 of the music
david224 hey so what did you think of the music
david224 ok 
prettygreat Yep
prettygreat Total bullshit
david224 Ok i work still really busy
#ShareTheRemote    prettygreat |  Haegin: No, I think it's debian
#ShareTheRemote    prettygreat |  Haegin: Where do you reside? I'm yet to meet you... I think
david224 cool,   that is alwas good, Did you pay me for DragonForce
david224 ok
#mplayer         ergZay |  Haegin: well post a log and we can help
david224 well I can not see it on my last bank statement
#mplayer         ergZay |  Haegin: man file says: Each file takes the frame number padded with leading zeros as name.
david224 ok cool  will it you would be so kind as to pay me 20.50-(Airbourne ticket)
david224 cool
david224 tell me when best to down load and where to find it
david224 is this a good thing
david224 ok That is good
#bash         erUSUL |  Haegin: why you need to llop over the files? use -exec
#bash          erUSUL !find > Haegin
#bash        greybot |  Haegin: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/UsingFind
#cs-york         ^Tom__ |  Haegin: you want to use -0
#bash         erUSUL |  Haegin: read there. there is an example to loop (safely) over find output
#bash         erUSUL |  Haegin: you do not need -exec in the example
#bash         erUSUL |  Haegin: find folder/ -whatever -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' file; do ..... ; done
#bash         erUSUL |  Haegin: here http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/001 <<<<
#bash         erUSUL |  Haegin: found it?
#bash       swankier |  Haegin: I can, but it makes a really nasty solution
#bash       swankier |  Haegin: could you suggest a solution that's easy to read?
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: I tried. No dice.
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: I asked about that
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: I was given an insultingly roundabout no
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: Erm, so what exactly are you recommending. I've completely lost this train of thought
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: that's...worryingly stupid
prettygreat Funtastic
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: I ideally just want my data transferred
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: And I want not to have to bug the department for another one=shot MSDNAA Win 7Pro key ><
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: I realise this is all stupid
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: but I appreciate the advice anyway
#ShareTheRemote @          Remy I made sure to make fun of him for that on Skype, Haegin
Sparkesinator i have a feeling hes ignoring what were saying :s
Sparkesinator yea
Sparkesinator the Dept would only give me one key
#cs-york       blue_rose the hacksoc event says bar crawl
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: How many have you done?
x5315 now that was just mean :p
x5315 he totally asked for that
x5315 yes, but it was the intention of saying it
x5315 but he has the auto-come back thing on
x5315 yep
x5315 anyway, he was trying to be mean
x5315 and as you saw, i was only banning him for a few minutes
x5315 and i'm sure he saw it slightly as the joke it was :p
#cs-york       blue_rose Do it on the hacksoc bar crawl
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, next episode of dollhouse is next friday
blore hi

#ShareTheRemote      cornholio |  Haegin: blackcats games
#ShareTheRemote @      AnthraX |  Haegin there's bitgamer
#ShareTheRemote  dark_skeleton| Haegin: BCG, thats right
#ShareTheRemote  dark_skeleton| !user Haegin
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Nope: I have no friends, hence nobody to give me invites
#ShareTheRemote   dark_skeleton Im pretty sure it doesn't work like that, Haegin :]
david224 ep
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Wiht you
david224 so not a lot
[ICR] Hey
[ICR] Now dreamhost are less fooked can you try sending me the login details for it again?
[ICR] 'Cos I got nothing through last time
[ICR] Cheers
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It'd be for a Drobo
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: definitely worth looking into
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I really want to do *something* for the wiki or course tools, but I've nfc what
[ICR] Gottit. Cheers
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I need to get over the CS problem of wanting to redesign the CPU and everything in between before I'll write my business logic
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: there is that
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: previous years haven't been bad
#cs-york           [ICR] Oh damnit, I ballsed up the subject on the latest hacksoc mailing list email :(
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: yah
#ShareTheRemote        erik212 |  haegin can you run gspot in wine?
#cs-york  tommylommykins There's a hacksoc Mailing list?
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Yeah, of Course.. I'll send you all the gay porn if you want :)
#ShareTheRemote           gmn64 and haegin, what do the rules say?
#rtorrent        rudi_s_ |  Haegin: Is xon/xoff disabled? Check stty -a and look for xon and xoff, normally ^S is mapped to this by the terminal. You can disable it with stty -ixon -xoff before starting rtorrent (for example in bashrc).
#rtorrent        rudi_s_ |  Haegin: Hm, weird. No idea, sorry.
#cs-york         Jalada |  Haegin: not bad for £8 though
jarnie Up for some TF2 in a lil?
#cs-york           [ICR] Would it be an idea to use topiclock and then just give me +t? That way I'm not an op, but I can change the topic for hackSoc stuff.
#cs-york       User_4574 well, it's been said that someone in hacksoc should have ops, and since tom's no longer chair...
#cs-york           [ICR] User_4574: the only reason someone in hacksoc needs ops is to change the topic. My suggestion does that.
[ICR] Cool
[ICR] Nope, "You need to be a channel op to do that"
[ICR] You need to remove +t from the channel and use ChanOp to protect the topic
[ICR] msg ChanServ SET #cs-york TOPICLOCK ON
[ICR] hmm
[ICR] You need to remove +t from the channel
[ICR] It's a channel one too
[ICR] +t channel is an IRC protocol thing to stop non-ops changing topic. Topiclock and user +t is a ChanServ thing to allow only certain people to change topic
[ICR] msg ChanServ FLAGS #cs-york -t
[ICR] Something like that
#cs-york           [ICR] Can you grant those privileges to the rest of the hacksoc committee?
[ICR] Is it based on nicks, or does it only work with registered/auth?
#ShareTheRemote    prettygreat |  Haegin: I had that problem last night
#ShareTheRemote          _312c |  Haegin, all that would do is make it slower, since you would not be connectable
#cs-york  *          emb read that as * Haegin is wet today
#ShareTheRemote    prettygreat |  Haegin: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
david224 how is the upload going
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: my point isn't that he should write the sort routine. it's that the class he's using that list inside of presumably has particular storage and access requirements which you've got to understand to justify the decision to use (for example) a list at all
terminator69 you need an invite?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: quite, but at some point you have to commit to using / ceasing to use that implementation
terminator69 yeah i have a few, what is your email?
terminator69 sent
terminator69 no worries, enjoy
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ;p
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: alternative students unions aren't unheard of
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: lol? :)
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Google.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: what's the point of this btw? :p
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I have one out of 4 (I htink I'm supposed to have four)
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: http://www-student.cs.york.ac.uk/~njel500/books.xml
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I have the ICS book... Computer organisation and Architecture
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: You can't receive it now?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: that's exactly not what I meant
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: It's done.. I think
#ShareTheRemote    callmechewy |  Haegin

#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: £2.5m isn't actually that bad...
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: pfft, do it
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I very much understand the reasons, I didn't say I disagree with it, just that I don't like it
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I'll text you if I see it
blore Hi
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Yes.
[ICR] Hey. For www.morethannothing.co.uk, is it possible to have a mysql database? How do I manage it?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: PM
#cs-york            Alan that hacksoc film night
#cs-york             emb MikeT: are hacksoc blogs up yet?
#cs-york          BidMod the only non-degree time I've had recently was the Hacksoc stuff and one shopping trip I'd been putting off to do more degree
#cs-york             emb hey Haegin
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: PM
#cs-york  *       BidMod slaps Haegin, after thinking he'd covered himself with the statement "in another county"
#cs-york  *       BidMod posts Haegin to another country
#ShareTheRemote        NightOwl yeah i wasn't hating on you or anything haegin
#cs-york       blue_rose you going the fringe after the hacksoc bar/pub crawl?
#cs-york  slugonamission Not sure if I'm going to hackSoc, I might start the fringe on campus though
#cs-york  slugonamission Or I might turn up to hackSoc, ut with a housemate
#cs-york     Tinned_Tuna MikeT: update hacksoc.org plzkthnx
[ICR] Hey
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: if not, it should be trivial to build gnu binutils for arm-cross
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: Who said anything about strings?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: that's fair enough, but my point was that laser`s absolute was a tad short-sighted :p
#cs-york           MikeT technically i don't want to go into town, CAUSE I FEEL REALLY FUCKIN ILL, but am making a commitment for teh hacksocz
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, we're bussing back (have already thought of that one :) )
[ICR] Hey. For http://www.morethannothing.co.uk/, is it possible to have a mysql database? How do I manage it?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: I need something more substantial. I've not eaten today
#cs-york          BidMod (@ Haegin's comment)
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: pm
#cs-york          DaveX_ this is a hacksoc event, how could i be fashionably late :P
#cs-york       blue_rose righty i think i'm almost done.. maybe a little too fringe for a hacksoc bar crawl
TheHatMan Yay

jensraaby :(
jensraaby except for with wiggle
jensraaby this is quite interesting: http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2009/12/01/saying-%E2%80%9Cgoodbye%E2%80%9D-to-my-ebay-shop/
jensraaby next film of my choice is lience of the Lambs
jensraaby Silence
jensraaby after your next film
jensraaby but you need to acquire this one for us
#cs-york         ^Tom__ |  Haegin: no, his car
jensraaby very good film, slight horror edge to it
jensraaby #24 in IMDB top 250
jensraaby have now
jensraaby looks good
jensraaby better than mine at least
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: gone?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: backing up Facebook would be more difficult and less legally straightforward
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin_: you can compile it and run it normally, reversed and rot-13ed
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin_, its not such a matter of stripping it, its reorganising it. I guess i could write one myself
#cs-york      Baldrick_ |  Haegin_: we need positions for the new key system that they are switching to for Grimston house
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, Tinned_Tuna wont accept that i had apt-get break during Ubuntu 9.04 to 9.10 upgrade
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin_: I said book, not author
#cs-york      Pola_bear |  Haegin_: Authors aren't books
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin_: idk, Abelson & Sussman have written some pretty dry stuff
#cs-york      Pola_bear |  Haegin_: Which?
#cs-york      Pola_bear |  Haegin_: No, but I've heard good things

prettygreat Oh right 
prettygreat I'll reimburse you for it
prettygreat http://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=series&id=76372&lid=7

#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin_: Newsflash, not everyone is a geek.
prettygreat They have other leechers though

#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: oh, you're looking for HolyGrailEditor
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: have you tried aptana?
#cs-york             U4 |  Haegin: why not write one?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: it's an eclipse environment, yah.
#cs-york @       Jalada |  Haegin: only in the sense that I hate it
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yay priorities...
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: in need of hardware? even wish you were still at Comprec in York? :P
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: as in, it worked, or, it's been pulled off air?
#cs-york       Dr_Metal |  Haegin, thanks!
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: http://pogdesign.co.uk/cat/
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: the eztv.it ones?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: it should only be rar'd if it's over newsgroups
#ShareTheRemote          McArty i dont think so Haegin
#cs-york       m0nkfish |  Haegin: sorry i don't know what that means
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, not really
#cs-york         Jalada |  Haegin: what is it?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: eep, why so much effort?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: this is CLI output
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: also, your suggestion wouldn't work, seeming as this is output from the linker... there are no comments at that point!
#cs-york           x5315 sounds like Haegin has actual work to do
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: the only reason people {tidy|rearrange} their room, is because they're trying to avoid real work
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin_: there's a campag bike that i regularly see on campus with shimano fittings :P
jasoncullip lol
hoffish what?
hoffish ok....
hoffish good
hoffish for you?
hoffish only all right?
hoffish um.... lots of work mostly this week but I went to Collectormania last weekend so that was fun
hoffish like a convention thing
hoffish no theer are comics
hoffish there are lots of things
hoffish stuff from tv shows, anime, comics, anything like that relaly
hoffish yeah
hoffish surprisingly
#cs-york       m0nkfish |  Haegin_: from a windows machine
hoffish London- we went becaus ethere were Supernatural people and stuff there
hoffish yeah- its awsome
hoffish what else you got on there?
hoffish oh ok
hoffish when you let off for Christmas?
hoffish oh ok
hoffish so you done anything other than work recently?
hoffish that's not so good
hoffish You'll have to get rid of something, then
hoffish fair enough
hoffish that's not a good thing
hoffish i'm more of a throw everything out and start again type of peson
hoffish I never do want it
hoffish I am sensible with my chucking
hoffish that's because you are a hoarder
hoffish why?
hoffish oh dear
hoffish not so god
hoffish *good
hoffish You can't keep them in case you fit into them again in the near future?
hoffish That's only one size isn't it?
hoffish Oh ok
hoffish then you will need new
hoffish I guess boys tend to do that
hoffish Obviously not
hoffish you had to grow into your limbs at some point, I suppose
hoffish nevermind- a bit less gangly, If that makes sense
hoffish no
hoffish but still
hoffish Oh dear- Missi is rying to attack my record player
hoffish the turning record is just too exciting I think
hoffish it does but I haven't got it down because I am changing records quite regualrly
hoffish isn't that really old?
hoffish hmmm
hoffish not really my thing
hoffish What's it about?
#cs-york       m0nkfish |  Haegin_: is it like a two-way shortcut
hoffish yeah
hoffish oh ok- sci-fi then
hoffish yeah.... not really my thing
hoffish oh ok
hoffish ok
hoffish I need to go write now
hoffish bye
hoffish u 2
#cs-york          Jalada hey Haegin
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: did you sort your gcc problem?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, and....?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: a) They count websites differently b) Who the heck will be plowing through 43,300,000 sites? :P
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, if im searching for Obama, the imo Bing presents the best 2 first options, his wikipedia entry, and his website
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: but the whitespace is to the right. Which is easy to collapse or expand. The new bar is to the left, which takes up more valuable screen space
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: me too. If I have a middle click
#cs-york            ^Tom Alan: Haegin & maybe jalada
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: heh, i'm looking at it again
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: but it seems really... unconfigurable?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you have some dvorak remaps in there too?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: how do i get a gnome-panel going with it?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, I'll put some things on Flickr...
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: how do i reload with new config?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i mean from a default config
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: is it easier to try and use xmonad inside gnome instead of bits of gnome inside xmonad?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: heh, parents and their rose-tinted view of their kids :P
#cs-york  *       BidMod is back ... I've found seven photos that Haegin and others might want to look at - I spent 30min finding and sizing, then 15min looking for the "guest pass" feature in Flickr :(
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: what does that word in the bottom bar say?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Yeah it's beautiful
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: you know what the return key is, right?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: We just got a PC from comprec and used that
#xbmc         noptys |  Haegin: this is the issue I had yesterday, I can confirm its fixed with an upgrade to 190 nvidia drivers
#xbmc         noptys |  Haegin: and I used the nvidia vdpau ppas as well; make sure you upgrade dkms, its not listen in the Requires
#xbmc         noptys |  Haegin: sadly that actually reboots the box, I was using MediaStream skin before and I think it actually had a button that did XBMC.RestartApp
#cs-york         Jalada |  Haegin: either you're missing the point or that was a very complex analogy to anal sex
#xbmc         noptys |  Haegin: me too on linux, I've been using that button as the easiest way (that I know of) to rescan all the sources for new media to scrape
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: foxwood
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, did you get the Flickr link from the scrollback, or not?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, I think I need to get a paid one .. but I wasn't sure
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, I do have RAW, but only software to read the format, not write to it :| how bizarre!
#cs-york          BidMod also, Haegin, just a thought, but why not ask Jens, since he is probably the better photographer?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, I meant write RAW to RAW, without bothering with other formats, but I mostly use jpgs straight from the camera because I can just use them anywhere
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: umm, that depends on what level of compression your JPEG has...
#cs-york         Jalada |  Haegin's is 1024x820
#cs-york          BidMod email is now on way - you can see the difference in the file size between yours and Haegin's file - one done using GIMP, one by Picasa. guess which is which :P
#cs-york          Jalada considering they don't even allow Hacksoc stuff to do...oh...ANYTHING
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: ping
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: thankfully I've always had a terminal, be it virtual, or my trust VT220, to hand to do it
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: `:! killall vim`
#postgresql           flux |  haegin, no forcing required, just do it
#postgresql          Tuxie |  Haegin: ?
#postgresql           flux |  haegin, maybe pgadmin requires that, but postgresql doesn't
#postgresql           flux |  haegin, it's difficult to update individual rows from a GUI if you don't have a primary key..
#postgresql           flux |  haegin, I don't do windows either, but if you have the psql tool, psql < foo.sql should work..
#postgresql          Tuxie |  Haegin, flux: pgadmin should be fine to use and not be the cause of this
#postgresql          Tuxie |  Haegin: how are you trying to create the table? there is no requirement what so ever to have a primary key on a table
#postgresql           flux |  haegin, if you have foreign keys, it requires primary keys too. could that be the issue? and I don't think you can 'force' around that..
#postgresql          Tuxie |  Haegin: no, but "double precision" is
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: yeah, next year they're so using mew
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, hahaha
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: find is ok, and no i don't think so
#ShareTheRemote           havoc ever hear of the FCC Haegin? :P
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: ?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Actually it's massively important and while it annoys me massively that it probably won't give us a hugely binding deal, it should at the very least get some of the more complex issues like forestry protections worked on sooner rather than later, and there is the possibility that Obama will say "Hey, if the Senate won't pass something, I'll EPA their asses anyway, so here's something a bit binding". Also, to my knowledge, most countries hav
#cs-york +       TobboT |  Haegin, TheHatMan is right here!
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: reping, i'll try to remember to catch you another time
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: Alan yeah, pretty much

jensraaby right
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: ah, the HF/AIP joint surveillance project thingy?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, well, I had Meatloaf, Nightwish, Abba, Rocky Horror, DragonForce and Weird Al as I recall
#cs-york        stewbert sup Haegin, want in? :D
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you managed to bond wireless and wired together+
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: that gives me a great idea...
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you should connect the wireless to somebody else's AP...
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah, i tried cracking WEP before, but it was too far away :(
jensraaby is that the bonding?
jensraaby awesome
jensraaby I won't mention, but Jason will probably notice after a while
#cs-york        stewbert Hmm, Haegin? :
#cs-york  tommylommykins A rival to hacksoc?
#cs-york       TheHatMan The Hacksoc 2010 Calendar?
#cs-york       TheHatMan WE NEED A HACKSOC GAMES NIGHT
#cs-york             emb then quickly to hacksoc :D
adrianracu oi
adrianracu im happy to report that all is well in gwylio world
adrianracu love is the answer
#cs-york       TheHatMan We should make a Hacksoc group
#cs-york       TheHatMan http://steamcommunity.com/groups/hacksoc
#cs-york       TheHatMan Okies, I need suggestions for a new profile pic for the hacksoc steam group :D
#cs-york           [ICR] Tinned_Tuna: you around? If you give me your CS email I'll add you to the hacksoc mailing list
#cs-york            Alan 13:37 < Haegin> :)
#cs-york             U4 |  Haegin: ?
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: didn't I advise you of this around a year ago? :P
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: this is like my experience with BT in some ways - the only way it will ever be fixed will be if all of the dissatisfied customers move, and most don't want/know/care how to... :|
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: are you have connectivity issues again? you keep bouncing in/out :|
#cs-york          BidMod hi Haegin_- is there anyone in at your end, or are you still bouncing in and out because of connectivity issues?
#cs-york           MikeT why is the #cs-york topic being set to what "the hackSoc committee" wishes everyone to be having
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: buy two
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: people normally use NSArray :P
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: what doesn't work about it?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: in C or Java?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: how're they measuring size?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: well it'd be kinda nice to be able to, you know, write applications
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: xcode says the array size is −1, but it still seems to work - i.e. I can put values in it and get those same values back out
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: lol, awesome. I just tried defining a function which returns an array and "error: 'f' declared as function returning an array"
#cs-york           x5315 blue_rose: email social@hacksoc.org
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, LOL

#cs-york          BidMod Alan: next time we have a hacksoc evening in the CSCR, come and meet the 2nd years :P
#cs-york       TheHatMan Heya Haegin
#cs-york  Baldrick_worki hi Haegin
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin: he won't sleep again, ever.
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: surely it will be free at this rate?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: they're good at providing half a service half of the time for 3/4 the cost?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: BT was like that when they added £25 onto our bill randomly
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: They suck more than even the most slutty and competent gay porn stars.
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: lol semantic typo
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin and I can definitely vouch for concentrating on the report - we passed, and mine/Dave's project just outright didn't work, and Haegin shot me with a DAC
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: if you recall, the op-amp was my solution to not using analogue in MCP :)
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: nice
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin: the status of that statement can never be evaluated to true or false :-(
#cs-york             U4 |  Haegin: hai
#cs-york     Jalada_FSS |  Haegin: he told us in the practical :P but yeah

prettygreat Nope
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin__: mm, I doubt people wanna meet up to talk Scheme much :(

prettygreat Though I enjoy being member and having 1TB up
prettygreat When I finally get around to building that server
prettygreat Eww why
prettygreat Christian music is the work of the devil
prettygreat Is your connection saturated?
prettygreat I could download a bunch of your stuff from what
prettygreat Boost that buffer a bit
prettygreat Ah.
prettygreat ..it's not for wanting it
prettygreat It's to boost your buffer :P
prettygreat ahkay
prettygreat That's how I got mine
prettygreat seedbox + RSS of iLife 
prettygreat Well when iife 09 came out
prettygreat I uploaded about

#tovid        smacnay |  Haegin__, I think ffmpeg was added later so the option to use it was added.  I have used the ffmpeg option and been nicely surprised.
#cs-york             U4 |  Haegin__: awww
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin__, Wordpress have. the thin client can't handle it :|
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: We sort of did, in the form of last week's practical
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I did a mock assesment anyway, but I htink it would have been nice to do it collaboratively..

jensraaby http://binarybonsai.com/2009/11/24/most-dice-arent-that-random/
hoffish what?
hoffish oh right
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Me
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin: it's an even prettier place
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin: I know... been there in summer. Wasn't fun at all
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: hush
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin: You're safe anyway
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin: want the essay?
#cs-york  boxxyloxxykins Haegin: Where to find?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Boxxin, its firefox, just kill and remove all of it, its all useless
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Boxxin, i dont want a website to do it
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Boxxin, well my feeds are synces
emb sure thing...whose? o.o
emb o ok :]
emb wewt. I have some ideas along those lines for upcoming placement students, but will spam that later
emb *reads*
emb seems fine :)
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Boxxin, imo its pointless
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Boxxin: can we make #cs-york voiced?
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Boxxin: you have the idea.
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Boxxin: I have /ignored him, but the one-sided convo is weird.
emb it's not worse :P
emb just a bit harsh on the eyes
emb mm. more less easy to read :p
#cs-york        Dr_Metal Hello to Haegin as well
emb :)
emb but yeah, I think placement students should go in on a level footing wrt what they understand as their obligations and entitlements
emb darker text if possible?
emb that's great :)
emb (re: above) obviously not wanting to militarise people, but an understanding of basic health + safety (beyond "desk assessments"), what questions you don't have to answer in an interview, where to get help with stuff if necessary, signs of work related stress
emb and so on
emb quite. needs moderating by people who aren't on a knife edge too though ;p
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: you might want a blurb about where the data's going at the top
#cs-york @           emb U4: Haegin
#cs-york              U4 or Haegin
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: I want a present to :(
#cs-york  *          emb has totally never been hacksoc nipple crippled
#cs-york  *          emb slams DaveXi into Haegin 
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: do have a bike?
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: and you say that no snow == teh suck?
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: k
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: how would that work?
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: that's not to say that running ! related history commands is a good idea
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: trueish, but i tend to err on the side of caution
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: use up
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: ah, but no
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: If you start doing it on an empty buffer, it does up.
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: anyway, i find that ctrl+r bar is better, safer and more flexible than !bar, and that !n or !-n i also tend not to
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Lets you do vi ftex then <left><left><left><tab> -> vi foobar.tex
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Not really, you have to tell it where to separate prefix and suffix, and that's with the cursor position.
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Possibly.
#cs-york          Jalada hahahaha, I like Haegin's 'options' on his feedback
#cs-york     Jalada_AGM |  Haegin: that's a bit random looking, hah
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Get a Boxee box?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Also, Windows 7 adds £100 to the price?
#cs-york       Baldrick |  Haegin: find the linux version and put on win 7 if you want it - from dept so free :)
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: No idea, though it's ION based
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: The beta isn't out yet, though it looks interesting, even if it does amuse me that the vast majority of their users are on OS X (80%) yet the video optimisations have been done for Windows.
adrianracu its okay
adrianracu im home
adrianracu you can stop worrying
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: !
nessieliberation_ hi
nessieliberation_ how're you?
nessieliberation_ cool
nessieliberation_ so, next year...
nessieliberation_ we should probably think about some stuff if you're still game
nessieliberation_ jens?
nessieliberation_ i'll be away from york from (approximately tomorrow) to (apprx. 30th Dec) or so
nessieliberation_ so i'll be around then
nessieliberation_ i'm back at work on the 4th
nessieliberation_ uni
nessieliberation_ aye
nessieliberation_ ideally near here
nessieliberation_ here = broadway/hes laney area
nessieliberation_ where you were last year is a we bit further than ideal, but the right direction
nessieliberation_ this house is perfectly fine for 4 people, and dirt cheap for 4.
nessieliberation_ although the living area isn't perfect.
nessieliberation_ 2 sheds and a panty
nessieliberation_ *pantry
nessieliberation_ my bike lives in the pantry
nessieliberation_ jason leaves his outside everyday, and it's still here
nessieliberation_ yup
nessieliberation_ there are 3 similarly sized small rooms
nessieliberation_ which are big enough to live in, but not huge
nessieliberation_ and then there's a large room with a double.
nessieliberation_ we reckoned this year that if he'd have gotten a 4th person +6 and -2 for average seems fair (so 8 quidish diff to make up for the size)
nessieliberation_ i've got a very large amount of stuff
nessieliberation_ and would want the space, but not nec the double bed
nessieliberation_ whether or not it would be possible to swap a single with the double i don't know.
jensraaby http://www.borders.co.uk/index.php hmm easy christmas presents?
nessieliberation_ i mean i've got a lot of stuff in the smaller room...
nessieliberation_ it's just not quite big enough for me to have everything.
nessieliberation_ about 4.5x2.8 for this room would be my guess.
nessieliberation_ but you'd certainly be welcome to look
jensraaby yup
jensraaby http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=BS8+1RE&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=Bristol,+Avon+BS8+1RE&gl=uk&ei=XPMrS6vqNtWr4QbvxOmQCQ&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CAkQ8gEwAA
jensraaby cool gmail chat changed the url to the postcode!!
nessieliberation_ if there were 3 people, then it would be worth seeing how much helen's old house is/whether it's available.
nessieliberation_ aye
nessieliberation_ when i say dirt cheap, i mean 50 per week
jensraaby http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/8421429.stm?ls
nessieliberation_ aye
nessieliberation_ and it's in a good place
jensraaby http://www.youtube.com/v/DETqglIBYMY&hl=en_GB&fs=1& hmm Danish police can be annoying
jensraaby but they do speak good english]

User_4574 hi
User_4574 so what did you do to mordor, and how do i use it to torrent?
User_4574 ok, so where do i put .torrents in, and where do i get output from?
User_4574 i put a .torrent in /home/harry/downloads/torrents/movies
User_4574 can i see progress somehow?
User_4574 does rtorrent not have a web thing?
User_4574 that i can links into?
User_4574 root@mordor:~# su harry
User_4574 To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
User_4574 See "man sudo_root" for details.
User_4574 harry@mordor:/root$ screen -x r
User_4574 Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check.
User_4574 nvm
User_4574 i'll do it on my laptop
User_4574 can you remove it?#
User_4574 ah ok
User_4574 done
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: the routes I travel over have all been done relatively recently :D
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: when's that ever going to be?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: I'd love to see a Maglev go up Shap!
hoffish oh good- what 's the plan, then?
hoffish ok but where we meeting and at what time
hoffish oh
hoffish well I can't really tell her about it if I odnt know details
hoffish at what time?
hoffish ok- so what food do I have to bring?
hoffish are we brnging for the whole group?
hoffish what?
hoffish how many?
hoffish oh ok
hoffish who is bringing something to drink>
hoffish oh ok
hoffish you coudl facebook oscar
hoffish ok
hoffish lozzi can't make it, then?
hoffish oh right
hoffish All right then
hoffish I think i've got it all figured out in my mind
hoffish I might be able to bring left over cake from the weekend
hoffish but maybe not
hoffish We'll see
hoffish it is a very awsome cake
hoffish will there still be snow left by tomorrow?
hoffish so we are having a snowball fight?
hoffish ok... although I have to wera my glasses because I have crap in my eye so people will have to be careful nt to knock them off my face because they have been bent out of shape.
hoffish just a warning
hoffish um... bread, crisps, sweets, cake, apples
hoffish things like that?
hoffish i dunno, do i?
hoffish wouldn't it be easier for you to bring drink and make everyone els ebring the food?
hoffish justbecause then it is covered and you can just tell everyone to bring food then
hoffish well- why don't you add that as part of the facebook group?
hoffish she reads facebook more than she looks at her phone
hoffish oh
hoffish weird
hoffish oh that's ok then
hoffish oh
hoffish I guess I'll make another cake, then
hoffish see you tomorrow
hoffish i'd better go now, though
hoffish bye
hoffish :-)
hoffish oh-  just thought
hoffish I think Ruth is back from Reading
hoffish She might be in Swindon with Stu, though
hoffish but it might be worth aksing her if she wants to come along. 
hoffish that's a good idea

#cs-york         Jalada |  Haegin_: would it be safe do you think to tell this to drop back to my 2.6.28 kernel, even if it's running 2.6.31 right now?
Homoglyph Yes.
Homoglyph Although I wasn't then, I was out shopping.
Homoglyph Naw, I would've plugged you back in if it had been an issue anyway.
Homoglyph No
Homoglyph I said if I had, I'd've plugged you back in.
Homoglyph Specifically, when I left.

#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: ugh, do I have to install an AV? :(
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: its not like its filtered, but I'm not going on any in halls
#cs-york          DaveXi Yeah we did that Haegin
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I did that once. It was called early childhood :D
nessieliberation_ well, specifically:
nessieliberation_ south of hull road, north of where you were last year
nessieliberation_ erm, it could, but i'd rather not live on/off hull road
nessieliberation_ unless there are significant perks
nessieliberation_ and somewhere for a bike
nessieliberation_ the problem with there is that it's a far trek to the south of campus, the hill is in play, and it's quite busy there
nessieliberation_ even for CS it's not that practical
nessieliberation_ as you have to go up the hill
nessieliberation_ (there's no cut through at the end of farrar
nessieliberation_ just a brick wall)
nessieliberation_ it's a bitch of a hill though
nessieliberation_ although i guess with CS/Physics, some hill is going to be involved for at least you
nessieliberation_ ok
nessieliberation_ then badger hill/fulford makes more sense
nessieliberation_ it's flat to the south of uni
nessieliberation_ true, but how often are you in town?
nessieliberation_ it's also on a bus route or 2
nessieliberation_ i tend to think that uni is visited daily, so i work around that, and then after that, it's not that much difference as to where, "close" to town is practical as far as far from town
nessieliberation_ the only thing in favour for townites is that the the #4 runs until later than the #7 does
nessieliberation_ but there's always the 415 back later on
nessieliberation_ (as we found out yesterday when jason's friend got bus stuck)
nessieliberation_ yeah, bike or walk if you want, if it's further than that/colder, cab
nessieliberation_ tis about 6 quid from the station to here, if it's really that bad, it's not too bad
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: depends how old really
jensraaby sorry, not actually sitting at the PC with Gmail open...
jensraaby the SMS worked though
jensraaby cold
jensraaby it had a cleansing ride this evening, but met the evil gritter in the other direction
jensraaby hasn't been used for a while
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: i'd rather not ruin my drink :)
jensraaby when I'm outside I seem to always be walking or biking so I don't feel the cold so much
jensraaby any good?
jensraaby what? you get to keep the old one
jensraaby ?
jensraaby sounds good, the brompton is not going to keep up with your Rubble
jensraaby sorry Ribble
jensraaby :p
jensraaby fun roll home?
jensraaby brompton is actually quite good on snow so far, other bike succumed to the ice going round a corner
jensraaby nope, just a bruised ankle
jensraaby which bike computer did you acquire?
jensraaby strada or something like that?
jensraaby I was getting tempted to make a mni-ITC OpenSolaris NAS earlier this week
jensraaby sorry ITX not ITC
jensraaby but tried to set Solaris up as a VM and now dislike it
jensraaby ZFS is a nice idea, but getting the Sun CIFS server working was a pain
jensraaby but it is only £60 for an Intel Atom dual core on a motherboard. ION is a bit more
jensraaby yeah, Little Falls 2 has Gigabit and lesser graphics than ION, depends whether I want something that could be an HD media centre as well as NAS
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: erm, i'll have an e please bob
jensraaby andrew is also considering where to live , as his previous email indicates - did you reply to that one?
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: Yes, we do!
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: Nah, just some guy came by with comments likde, "A student? That's what we like to see!"
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: True.
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: We just spent the morning discussing it =P
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin reckons 3.
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: I didn't see, and so have no evidnce myself.
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin:

#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: i was in bristol
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: yeh, it's meant to be really good
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: PtP has them all as I recall
#cs-york @        x5315 |  Haegin: well, i'm not really about the drinking of the booze
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, lol im trying to lose 5st
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: it's just a snowman :P
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: we want gigabit though :)
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: yes, but in that case "upgrading for pro-ness!!!" means "I have a small penis :("
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: harder to do
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: no, it'd require the cable to be moved from one switch to the other
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: core (24-port smart Netgear) -> 2/3x16 port Netgear, 2x24 port Linksys, 1x8 port US Robotics
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: they're dume, you'd get broadcast storms
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you still haven't got the idea that there is no correlation between placement and set of activities?
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: the retro tourney wasn't on the network
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin: in the cool part of hte country it is

#bash          geirha !seq > Haegin
#bash        greybot |  Haegin: seq(1) is a highly nonstandard external command used to count to 10 in silly Linux howtos. Use one of these instead: for x in {1..10} (bash3.x) or for ((x=1; x<=10; x++)) (bash 2.04+) or i=1; while [ $i -le 10 ]; do ...; i=$(($i+1)); done (ksh/POSIX)
#bash         geirha |  Haegin: posix script that uses expr. Junk.
#bash         geirha |  Haegin: Basicly all implementations of getopt are broken, except GNU's. So if you can be certain that GNU getopt will always be available, you can use it.
#bash          geirha !varcaps > Haegin
#bash        greybot |  Haegin: By convention, we capitalize environment variables (PAGER, EDITOR, ..) and internal shell variables (SHELL, BASH_VERSION, ..). All other variable names should be lower case. Remember that variable names are case-sensitive; this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables.
#bash         geirha |  Haegin: echo $IMAGE_UPLOAD[$i]  You're using arrays wrong. echo "${IMAGE_UPLOAD[i]}"
#bash          geirha !$[ > Haegin
#bash        greybot |  Haegin: Obsolete, deprecated syntax for math. Don't use it. Use $((...)) instead.
#bash          geirha !ls > Haegin
#bash        greybot |  Haegin: Don't try to parse ls output. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs
#bash          geirha !tests > Haegin
#bash        greybot |  Haegin: In bash; use [[ .. ]] to test strings and files. Use (( .. )) to test numbers or execute arithmetic expressions. You should *only* use [ .. ] when writing an *sh* script; *not* a bash script!
#bash         geirha |  Haegin: That sounds very odd. What's wrong with 0 exactly?
#bash         geirha |  Haegin: There's something weird with your bash
#bash         geirha |  Haegin: Run the script with -x
#bash        evalbot |  Haegin: foo
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: It's a bit late though... now all the big shows are up :[
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: Oh?
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: It does, you need to, like, do setup and stuff
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, heh, in Ballmer's view certainly
#cs-york           MikeT oh come off it Haegin
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: shock horror, words have more than one meaning
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: So does slate, especially where I'm from
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: so we should pander to the ignorant?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin, Homoglyph: done your IPAM writeup yet? :)
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: 15th
#cs-york        daeghnao And it would be a bit weird for some other people I hang out with like Baldrick or Haegin or Sunshard or [ICR]
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: where abouts?
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yep
#cs-york       User_4574 huh, in revising TOC, i now understand why HAckSoc is considered 'cliquey'
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, no
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: I did as a kid, alas my usual reading time is taken up with sex and cycling these days :(
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i don't read books, i can't do it anymore, i don't have the patience to finish one, so i end up trying to read 3 at the same time
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: audiobooksforfree.com have sherlock holmes, i highly recommend them
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: aye, see thingy
nessieliberation_ hiho
nessieliberation_ my only comments so far be that there'd better a lot of house for the money at the hewort one
nessieliberation_ heworth even
nessieliberation_ and that i need to be somewhere from the beginning on july onwards (aka continuously over summer)
nessieliberation_ however there'd be a good chance of being able to find someone to stay with for much of the sumer
nessieliberation_ *summer
nessieliberation_ but by 1st october (as at least one of them is), it might be hard to find people to stay with
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: k, i got through adv, mem & return all on audiobooks
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: that's the ish :p
#bash        lhunath |  Haegin: sed -n 7p
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i'm not sure you get the joke :p
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i have a feeling that MikeT has no intention of getting a pixi or a hp tablet
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: 0.o
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: sure, but I'm not banking on our roads de-icing while yours are still snowy :(
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin: i read that as snowball jesus
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, didn't the angels with Satan get kicked out too to become devils?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin, aye, Good Omens ftw
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, well it was snowing
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: real men don't need to drive tanks, real men have wheels
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, what climate change? have you seen all of the snow? :p
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: sounds about right
#cs-york  slugonamission Nn Haegin
#ShareTheRemote    prettygreat |  Haegin is working on an auto-upload script which looks sexy
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: no...the exams are just easier than they are now :P
#cs-york  slugonamission Or yeah, what Haegin said
jensraaby are you loitering on this at work?
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: True, you should.
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: It's my IPAM.
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: Which gets more than the main system
nessieliberation_ pong
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: Rather, it shouldn't be.
nessieliberation_ k
nessieliberation_ if it's 3 bed, try, erm, that other one
nessieliberation_ helen's old
nessieliberation_ and/or it'd be nice to know, so i know whether to try and find another person
nessieliberation_ i've had a thought, and that's that to some degree, I don't mind how far away it is, i'd rather be a) in a nice/safe/welltodo area b) have a reasonable living room and c) have somewhere (ideally a garage) for storing a bike (preferably indoors)
nessieliberation_ bedroom size is desirable, but less important than those
nessieliberation_ ie - assuming the living room is ok, i can spend time there
nessieliberation_ right... back to work
nessieliberation_ did you ring helen's old landlord?
nessieliberation_ it's the best 3 bed student house i've ever seen
nessieliberation_ ta
jensraaby hey
jensraaby damn I missed cake
jensraaby don't worry, I've had plenty over Christmas :P
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: evidently not ;p
#bash         tuxdev |  Haegin, so what version are you targetting?  and what exactly are you trying to do?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ohai
#bash         tuxdev |  Haegin, depending on what key you want, it's often no too terribly difficult to hack something like an associative array in bash 3.x
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yes
#bash         tuxdev |  Haegin, it depends.  one way is to do something like env vars, that is, "foo=bar" entries

nessieliberation_ hi
nessieliberation_ a thought just occured to me
nessieliberation_ the house i lived next door to last year
nessieliberation_ 22 Anson drive
nessieliberation_ was going to be available this year for 67 or 68 pppw for 3 people
nessieliberation_ having just been completely redone
nessieliberation_ yup
nessieliberation_ i've got a number for it
nessieliberation_ 07710 511 079
#xmonad            ml| |  Haegin: yes you can, but xmobar needs to be built with xft for that to work
#xmonad            ml| |  Haegin: I don't know, but you try using xft and if it does not work that will be a goo clue ;) ... http://code.haskell.org/~arossato/xmobar/#utf-8-and-xft-support
#xmonad            ml| |  Haegin: seen ... http://code.haskell.org/~arossato/xmobar/
#xmonad            ml| |  Haegin: you can take a look at mine, but somethings will not work ... http://pastebin.com/fb0e8bec
nessieliberation_ will do later
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: indeed, mostly rain rather than snow here
#xmonad            ml| |  Haegin: here is an screenshot do you see how my xmobar looks like http://picpaste.com/2010-01-10-123735_1920x1200_scrot.png
#xmonad            ml| |  Haegin: np, is xmcores.pl working for you?
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I have a block of 9 pins, I need to get four connectors attached
jarnie oi
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Yup
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: it's alright
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: what are you doing first?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: did you put some IPAM in your IPAM yet?
jensraaby http://www.roadcyclinguk.com/video/finding-it-hard-ploughing-through-the-snow/4768.html
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: I agree
jensraaby http://clients.squareeye.com/uploads/brompton/2010/brochure.pdf
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: I read a couple of responses to that in the latest new scientist
jensraaby Intel infoscan touch monitor :-o
jensraaby http://www.sinclair-properties.com/properties/view_property.aspx?id=P1220&no_beds=Five&page=4
jensraaby classy and good price but long way from uni
jensraaby http://www.sinclair-properties.com/properties/view_property.aspx?id=P1048&no_beds=Five&page=3 much nearer uni and CS but a bit more expensive
nessieliberation_ yeah
#cs-york           MikeT not sure, you'd have to ask Haegin
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: oh hai
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: You'd compose breed traits if you had  to, not inherit them
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: no, I'm serious. trying to conceptualise a breed like that at MSD level is ridic
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: eeerm
#cs-york  Couennedousse |  Haegin: there's been worse
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, covered in ice
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, lots, it should be on the CSW page
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, the exam is likely to be similar if not the same as this year's, so you might want to get a copy of the PDF and start over the summer.
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin, oh?
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: What's the problem with it being on Thrusday?
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: If you like, leave the stuff you need here and I'll try and do it for you
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: Odd, mine is fine for once
nessieliberation_ thanks
nessieliberation_ i'll be out for a bit, and also want a reasonably early night
nessieliberation_ but will probably be around for a bit between about 9 and about 10
fleshTH yeah, that doesn't matter
fleshTH what version of chrome are you using
fleshTH because it works for me, and other people on chrome
fleshTH and it works in all other browsers
fleshTH so theres something wrong with your configuration
fleshTH upload.js
fleshTH then you are cached
fleshTH shift+f5
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: have you the means to get a 20m cat5 cable?
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: if you want i'll work it out, but 10 aint long enough, 15 or 20 would be
nessieliberation_ hi
nessieliberation_ have you anything planned for saturday day time?
nessieliberation_ all day saturday?
nessieliberation_ if there's a slot of a couple of hours, I was going to suggest a bike ride
nessieliberation_ especially if jason's not using his bik
nessieliberation_ I can just about guarentee a bike
nessieliberation_ as george is up for the ride, and he has 2 + his unicycles
nessieliberation_ although, for reference, not as much hassle as you might think.
nessieliberation_ i took mine to camb a while back
nessieliberation_ it was fine, but then i got to york and there was noone near the guard van
nessieliberation_ and noone on the platform that i could see (curved train)
nessieliberation_ so i was jamming the doors so the train didn't leave whilst trying to get someone's attention
nessieliberation_ yeah, someone else was trying to get his bike on, and he'd found someone just before the train went
nessieliberation_ otherwise my bike would have gone to newcastle
nessieliberation_ which would have been a pita
nessieliberation_ still, even with that, the reduced difficulty at the other end was worth it
nessieliberation_ as ruth's at girton, which is about 2 miles out of the north of town
nessieliberation_ and the station is about a mile south of the centre
nessieliberation_ yeah, 3.2miles between the 2
nessieliberation_ and we wanted to go out to a pub which is in the countryside just out of town
nessieliberation_ in the end, she had labyrinthitis, so didn't feel like cycling too much anyway
nessieliberation_ but ordinarily it would be worth it
nessieliberation_ heh
nessieliberation_ inner ear
nessieliberation_ aka bad balance
nessieliberation_ basically...
nessieliberation_ on login, it runs a file
nessieliberation_ which picks a random line from a file, and sets $HOME/.wallpaper as a symlink to that path
nessieliberation_ then when mpd track changes, it finds (or creates) a moodbar image of the current track
nessieliberation_ and blends that to the top of the current wallpaper
nessieliberation_ and then there's a conky bar which shows current track position in the same place
nessieliberation_ and also lyrics via conky on the side of the desktop, and normal conky on the other side
nessieliberation_ sure
nessieliberation_ le desktop isn't on the network, so you can grab it this w/e
nessieliberation_ don't suppose you have a small switch anywhere?
nessieliberation_ i have one, but ruth's got it, and i forgot to get it from her last time i went to see her.
nessieliberation_ network switch
nessieliberation_ preferably 100mbit, but 10mbit will do
nessieliberation_ heh
nessieliberation_ i've got one which might work, but it's slow, crappy and not all of the ports work.
nessieliberation_ also, just a longshot, but you don't have a spare ethernet adsl modem do you?
nessieliberation_ in the long term category, I want one, but don't want to buy one.
nessieliberation_ need to fix up our setup back at home
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Clearly you should stop watching TV shows.
#ShareTheRemote  mountainpengui and cool Haegin 
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin: not too cold for MY DISHWASHER
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Sounds like my house :/
#cs-york           MikeT night Haegin
blore Hey
blore How's things
#cs-york       Homoglyph Although I did have to put up with Haegin talking about in terms of whips, chains, etc.
#cs-york           lis0r Homoglyph: did haegin refer to the toolchain as Mistress?
#cs-york             emb Is Haegin with you on this? ;p
#cs-york       Homoglyph Evening, Haegin
nessieliberation_ hi
nessieliberation_ erm, hey
nessieliberation_ not bad
nessieliberation_ erm, can i ask a favour?
nessieliberation_ do you have a paypal account?
nessieliberation_ any chance i can borrow some money sending?
nessieliberation_ i want to send €20 to germany
nessieliberation_ euros
jensraaby another wiggle £10 off £50
jensraaby tonight
jensraaby 00..00
jensraaby http://www.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=21893
nessieliberation_ left
nessieliberation_ yeah, please
Sunshard SYN
Sunshard yay!
Sunshard Are you thinking about housing next year w Bidmod?
Sunshard ach, sounds like you're set up :( I'd asked BidMod if  I could Tagalong
Sunshard He said he'd ask you but he's probably revising away
Sunshard hmmm, any recommended housing agencies?
Sunshard I know that I don't trust firstchoiceaccomodation; they're ours and they're pretty lax at checking.
Sunshard I have my amazingly fall-apart room to witness
Sunshard hmm
Sunshard whistles?
Sunshard what sort of price range are these fellers though?
Sunshard whoa
Sunshard that sounds reasonable
Sunshard better than ours
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: p'ppong
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: the web of knowledge!
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: do you need it for work?
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: hang on
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: google scholar'd it?
Sunshard do you have their websites?
Sunshard thanks :)
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: go to http://www.york.ac.uk/library/ and click metalib on the right
Sunshard I suppose if you end up with a full group, I'll try to arrange something with poor, lost DaveXi
Sunshard he's utterly lost
Sunshard Just not very organised.
Sunshard :)
Sunshard A little scatterbrained
Sunshard I'm the one with no one to live with :(
Sunshard I need to source two more tenants who don't terrify DaveXi
Sunshard he's like a little kitten when we invite him over in terms of being terrified of the machinations of Nathan and Mikey :D
Sunshard nah, MikeT has as many good quirks as bad,
Sunshard and he internalises most of the ARGH ones
Sunshard so we're quite happy
Sunshard I'm probably the most demanding housemate anyways
Sunshard and MikeT practically does all the cleaning (which I used to have to do in dorms)
Sunshard saves me effort, leaves me filling guilty (with just a hint of spring breeze :P)
nessieliberation_ a place
nessieliberation_ yup
nessieliberation_ erm, I'll check the address
nessieliberation_ kosmor@knoblach.de
nessieliberation_ and 25USD i think
nessieliberation_ I'll just check
nessieliberation_ yeah, 25USD
nessieliberation_ it's cheaper than 20 euros
nessieliberation_ it should work out as about 15.35 in english money, but that'll depend on paypal
nessieliberation_ does paypal give the option of a message?
nessieliberation_ have you done it?
nessieliberation_ oki, if there's a message box, say.
nessieliberation_ i think services
nessieliberation_ or put it down as gift if it's better for tax reasons?
nessieliberation_ that sounds about right
nessieliberation_ subject: "kosmor", message: "alpha's .com"
nessieliberation_ yeah, that'll do
nessieliberation_ nope
nessieliberation_ tis for the game i've played for yonks
nessieliberation_ am getting a paid account
nessieliberation_ to build frigloads of ships
nessieliberation_ because there are 2 versions of the game
nessieliberation_ http://www.kosmor.com and http://www.kosmor.de
nessieliberation_ if you've got 2 minutes to spare every couple of days, can i persuade you to play?
nessieliberation_ alphabravo
nessieliberation_ yeah, but i need money ingame :
nessieliberation_ *:P
nessieliberation_ especially in the german one
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, ok thanks
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, ok thanks then
jensraaby not too keen on modding mine right now
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, I wouldn't try that.
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, julian- thanks for that advice
nessieliberation_ cheers
nessieliberation_ 376 pro days left now :)
nessieliberation_ they've come through
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: I have toothpain today too.
#cs-york      Homoglyph |  Haegin: You need to be less in a meeting and more going home.
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: doesn't help for getting data off the existing partitions :P
jarnie harry Mills
nessieliberation_ hi
nessieliberation_ there is a double mattress
nessieliberation_ I can lend you a pillow
nessieliberation_ therefore I suggest sleeping bag, andor double sheet and sleeping bag if you can't sleep on just a mattress
nessieliberation_ then:
nessieliberation_ network cable, 20ish metres
nessieliberation_ network switch if you've got one spare
nessieliberation_ and yes, i've got 2 bike loans lined up for a ride
nessieliberation_ one of them will come with a helmet
nessieliberation_ or will you do home->work->station and hence have yours?
nessieliberation_ i thought as much
jarnie Hi
nessieliberation_ it'll depend on where we're going as to whether i'll take mine
nessieliberation_ and how icy it looks
jarnie Can I borrow your soldering iron?
jarnie It's better then none :-)
jarnie Oh
jarnie Technical question.
nessieliberation_ k
jarnie You knowledgeable about capacitors?
jarnie I know capacitors have 3 main values describing their use:
jarnie Capacitance (obviously...), Temperature (working range before it explodes/dies) and Voltage.
jarnie I am about to buy replacement capacitors for this board, with identical temp/capacitance
jarnie My question is about the voltage:
jarnie Can I go higher?
david224 hey
jarnie The board is 12V and the caps Samsung put in are 10V (which explains why they die).
nessieliberation_ erm, if you mean what i think you mean, i don't think so
jarnie I can replace with identical ones and expect another 1-3 years out of them.
david224 cool so wht the plan
jarnie Or I can replace with 16V/25V etc and guarantee they wont fail.
jarnie 16V stores more energy than 10V, so will (I assume...) take longer to charge.
nessieliberation_ the voltage across the plates will approach to +V and -V
jarnie Will it break anything on the board?
david224 what type of doide is it
david224 zenor, normal
david224 also what broad
david224 sorry it a cap
jarnie I be back
jensraaby http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8458844.stm
david224 if you change the size or tolaence of the cap  without changing the resistive device that pair with it, you will change the timing on the broad with may lead to more problems
david224 sorry withg 
david224 = which
jarnie Any answers?
david224 it would be better handing it back to the manafacture
jarnie With 16V? How so?
david224 you could always try
david224 what is the plan for this weekend
jarnie You were on it? :)
jarnie urgh internet is playing up
david224 ok
david224 and on saturday
david224 ok how many?
david224 ok where about are they
jarnie So I won't damage anything by going with 16V, but it could mess up the timing and not work properly.
jarnie OR I can stick with 10V and not risk any damage, but caps will need replacing again in a few years?
david224 it is ok just rough area
david224 ok
jarnie There's one resistor and 9 capacitors in that bit of the board :P
jarnie Do you have any solder/
david224 so where is the amp
jarnie May I steal a few cm :-)
jarnie Cheers, appreciate it.
david224 ok so meeting you out side good ricke
david224 ok
jarnie What's the best component sites? I know www.rapidonline.com and www.maplin.co.uk - Maplin only has 16V and Rapid is £1.16 for caps and £6 for delivery...
david224 so meeting you out side good ricke at 10
jarnie :)
david224 cool i will be there, kathryn is in new vanbrugh halls
david224 cool i will try it, do you mean last year
david224 if so she live in the middle road  of the three that run parllel to each other, behind the saiburays
david224 hello
david224 yeah but the rooms where really small
david224 with a large main room
david224 but five might be better
david224 yeah it is good but  the road is a bit narrow like last year
david224 ok i will see you 10 on saturday,  is there any plans for saturday night
david224 all so  are you intersed  in going to see Hammerfall in london in may
david224 hello

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: oopslah.
nessieliberation_ hi
nessieliberation_ to go back to the list, you'll probably want some ice proof boots and something you can cycle in
nessieliberation_ erm, and you'll probably want to not forget your railcard
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: fail
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: oic
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: are you in York on Sat?
nessieliberation_ well, something you're comfortable in
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: YLUG or just a general visit?
nessieliberation_ i tend to go for long sleeved t-shirt & lightweight trousers, often rolled up
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: ah, fair enough
nessieliberation_ depending on whether real shorts feel wrong or not
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: not squee at BAe atm then? :(
nessieliberation_ btw - have you been to the welly?
nessieliberation_ if not we could pop in, especially if we're looking at frances street
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ah, likewise
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: lol 2 hours
nessieliberation_ alma terrace
nessieliberation_ it's a pub we'll get to know well if we move to one of the roads off the A19 along there
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yeah
nessieliberation_ if you drink bitter, you'll be amazed
nessieliberation_ it's gone up, it's not 1.36 for a pint
nessieliberation_ that's good, but 2.30ish per pint
nessieliberation_ it's the usual post cemetery juggling pub
nessieliberation_ it's only a couple of minutes from here by bike tbh
nessieliberation_ sam, who you've met at least once (think juggling + stray bbq)
nessieliberation_ anyway, she lived at the far end of wenlock
nessieliberation_ which was as close as she could get to the pub
nessieliberation_ i don't think there's a coincidence
nessieliberation_ bingo
nessieliberation_ well, "j2o" bottles i think
nessieliberation_ what with it being post:aldi visit
nessieliberation_ well, i'd remembered too, i just didn't think i'd need to go into that much detail for you
nessieliberation_ a bonus prize if you remember what she was wearing
nessieliberation_ indeed
nessieliberation_ wrong again i think
nessieliberation_ nope, i just remember
nessieliberation_ as she had been walking along the path on her way home when i spotted her
nessieliberation_ turquoise top and black 3/4 shorts i think
nessieliberation_ and sunglasses
nessieliberation_ oki
nessieliberation_ erm
nessieliberation_ text or otherwise which train you're getting
nessieliberation_ erm, not yet.
nessieliberation_ oki

#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Maybe try ScreenFlow or Snapz Pro?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: For the computer? It should be on the HD.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: As I said, why not use something else?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Screen video?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: don't use Snapz
#cs-york         julian- x5315: It watermarks and Haegin wants free

^Tom_ i really want to eat boar
^Tom_ the rest i'm not so fussed about
^Tom_ anything that you can do with chicken can be done more cheaply and with better taste with rabbit
^Tom_ i don't think so

dreadnought121 Inorite?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: ?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Er, I'm referring to buying the show, why would I pay less for it if it was easy?
#cs-york            zoz |  Haegin: dunno, buying stuff on Steam is pretty easy but I still pay full price for games on there?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: for someone not in york :)
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Er, no.
#cs-york      Pola_bear |  Haegin: Because tech talk scares him? And he can't cope with multiple chats at once :p
#cs-york      Pola_bear |  Haegin: It's his birthday, I will not attempt to make him wade through here
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Seeing as my old constituency (of which my area is freaking named after) was very, very, very nearly won by the Lib Dems during the byelection, it's kind of annoying to now be in what's apparently the safest Tory seat evar?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Hm?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Okay, so we vote for MPs, right?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: The MP that wins is the one with the most votes, even if it means they have 20% of the votes, if no other candidate has more than 20%, they win.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I fail at history, though I sense it involved a king and some rich land owners.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Welcome to why the Greens also have no power.
#cs-york            zoz |  Haegin: heh, yep. It's silly huh
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: if your hacksoc record is anything to go by, forgive me for not voting for you :P
#cs-york           [ICR] blue_rose: the hacksoc one? What's your email address and I'll add you
#cs-york       blue_rose [ICR], Like another pudding party? And also, would it be worth it attacking another fresher's lect, with news of the glorious hacksoc?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: so it's like a more useful netbook :P
^Tom_ do you know J Lloyd?, a 2nd? Year comp sci
#cs-york             emb Maud: go has a hackSoc
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: see qry
#cs-york           [ICR] ^Tom_: you coming to hacksoc?
#cs-york           [ICR] Well, I'm off to hacksoc
#cs-york           [ICR] ^Tom_: if you need me, come to hacksoc
#cs-york  *          emb senses this will be a slow night due to hacksoc
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: ok.
#cs-york      Baldrick_ |  Haegin: could you email me with the details of the people you are renting from this year?

dreadnought121 http://fukung.net/v/512/cool2uq.jpg
dreadnought121 Was it?
dreadnought121 Huh.
jensraaby what for?
jensraaby I need a tape measure
jensraaby it can wait until the weekend
jensraaby probably not
jensraaby unless you want to spend a lot
dreadnought121 D'you think 5400rpm drives will be sufficient?
dreadnought121 Although prices may have dropped slightly by October, but it;s unlikely
dreadnought121 Basically what I was looking at.
dreadnought121 http://www.ebuyer.com/product/166989
dreadnought121 Main differencr, it's 1.5TB
dreadnought121 And an F2
dreadnought121 £76.31
dreadnought121 Given my motherboard will be several hindred if I get the EVGA GT-270-W555 Classified.
dreadnought121 *hundred
dreadnought121 Popular drives, though
dreadnought121 The reviews a re all brilliant on it.
dreadnought121 That's what I thought
dreadnought121 And they're cheaper than a lot of others.
dreadnought121 "Not as quiet as other drives I've had"
dreadnought121 Apparent;y.
jensraaby ouch I need to stretch my hamstrings more often
jensraaby maybe I should do yoga
dreadnought121 Fair enough
dreadnought121 Which I don't need.
dreadnought121 The 7200rpm drives are all a fair amount more, is the problem.
dreadnought121 Unless I get smaller drives.
dreadnought121 Apparently, we're looking at a price hike for PC parts this summer, thoug
dreadnought121 *though
dreadnought121 The 1TB drives are ~80-90
jensraaby when do you want to start doing those?
dreadnought121 The 1.5s are 100+
dreadnought121 Mhm.
dreadnought121 Hence I was looking at trying to get away with a 5400
dreadnought121 Well, from what I can see, the data rate is fine
dreadnought121 So is the temperature when idle, I don;t know about in use.
dreadnought121 "constantly accessed during the expansion process for 81 hours and there's been no reported problems."
dreadnought121 Sounds promising, at least, if not definitive.
jensraaby ok, i'll put that in my calendar
dreadnought121 Some of the reviews do slate the speed, albeit slightly.
dreadnought121 And where some means "one".
dreadnought121 Ebuyer
dreadnought121 Just been reading through the customer reviews of them.
dreadnought121 Worryingly, everyone puts them in servers.
dreadnought121 Yeah, I get that
dreadnought121 But it;s more that nobody says anything about anything else
dreadnought121 I know, but raptors are expensive.
dreadnought121 Unless they;ve dropped significantly since I last looked (which was, admittedly, a while ago)
dreadnought121 Well, I'm doing coding on them, too.  IDeally with some decent size programs, is the plan.
dreadnought121 But raptors are still a lot.
dreadnought121 £181 for 300GB.
dreadnought121 Definitely.
dreadnought121 About 3 times faster, actually.
dreadnought121 I already worked that bit out. ^_^
dreadnought121 See, I know what I'm doing...I just thought I;d seek the voice of experience.
dreadnought121 It was more a case of wondering what your opinion was.
dreadnought121 True.
dreadnought121 I was tempted by SSDs, but after my motherboard budget increased, I have to make cutbacks.
dreadnought121 Well, my processor should be better next year.
dreadnought121 Since I plan on dual i7s.
dreadnought121 kk
^Tom_ oh ok

#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea, but still i got my application done and dusted, and therefore i got my offers in quicker, before most people had even applied
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, but only a handful of them refer to economics and I've no idea how many you have to do
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Is there a course that involves me getting shot in the head?

#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: tyvm
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Just apply tech reductionism to it.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: As in, when did it start happening, when does it happen, when doesn't it, what makes it better/worse etc.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Eaten/drank/worn/changed/washed/not done/etc.

#cs-york            zoz |  Haegin: it should be that if you put a file called tvshow.nfo in the Doctor Who (2005) folder, and inside it put the url -- http://thetvdb.com/?tab=series&id=78804&lid=7
^Tom_ i'll forward the ssh port to ssh.york at somepoint tomorrow probably

#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: I thought it was more or less the film equivalent of "Required Reading" for geeks.
^Tom_ erm, my desktop is off again
^Tom_ it was on overnight, but off after it was my alarmclock
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: did you remember to install SSH?

#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: as in, the first reference is number 3, the second is number 2, etc
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: changing \bibliographystyle{plain} to ieeetr
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Just to check, the GMA900 is old, but will it work for 7 even without Aero?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: only when you've only got 2 days to do it ...
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: especially if the reason you have that is because of other assessments
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: actually, I've only got one day to do it
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: but it will make me sad because I can't afford it anyway

#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: Not sure yet, why?
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: Yes, it is.

david224 right trying to ceate an acount
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I tend to name drives after their size, but in words
david224 some one has my player tag
david224 yeah
david224 am i going to need to set up audio
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Formatted capacity ;)
david224 well i do
david224 head
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Not sure they did for total disk capacity, hmm.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Does this somehow answer your question? http://img.skitch.com/20100202-dn8k3nw4bispri3f5f662j9nf2.png
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Pretty sure it's H.264 inside thus the transcodage.
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, not if there are errors, then it should report them as it finds them, but time depends on size of disk, and etc
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: About the disk sizing thing
david224 ok i have add you
david224 i think
david224 yeah
david224 da.loving
david224 i am  but can not here  you
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'm using Perian inside of QT7, it's worked well before, though this is for something rather higher res ;)

Dave differnce
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It finished and took more than an hour and the result is pixelated, while the original MKV is fine in Plex.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Randomly pixelated though, just at certain parts and they're big fucking blocks
Dave ok give me 5 minutes
julian- I am dealing with 30GB files here
julian- so there is that
julian- I'm trying MKVtools now
julian- It shouldn't have done any encoding to my knowledge, so eh
julian- the original mkv is perfect in plex
julian- and in mplayer
Dave ok I am  back
julian- omfg this is taking a while
julian- yeah
julian- 52%
julian- started at 10:13
julian- where did the file come from?
julian- what red?
julian- res*
julian- heh
julian- I'm guessing it wasn't a 30GB 1080p file
julian- ;)
julian- 75%
julian- Amusingly it tells me this via a log file filled with progress
julian- Just % though, nothing else
julian- Sorry, 35GB ;)
julian- heh
julian- to have been? *
julian- Oh wtf, it's finished the video and is now doing the audio separately/
[ICR] cheers
julian- It's made two files
julian- Yeah, so it better combine them later
julian- Me likey movie with sound
julian- MP4
julian- Er, surely the convert option should do that for me?
julian- yes
julian- http://www.emmgunn.com/mokgvm2dvd/mokgvmhome.html
julian- 36% progress for audio..
julian- I'd assume AAC
julian- AC3
julian- ugh
julian- Why can't I just purchase a nice 1080p H.264 file?
julian- I hate the hoop jumping if you want flexibility with optical media
julian- Because I like having the actual file in a format Quicktime will open
^Tom_ hi
^Tom_ erm, yeah
^Tom_ can you do summut for me?
^Tom_ firstly, can you send some money to a place with paypal
^Tom_ and 2ndly, is there anyway of finding if an email address is associated with paypol?
^Tom_ *paypal
^Tom_ you know the address you sent the previous thing to...
^Tom_ can you send 15EUR to it please?
julian- muxing now apparently
^Tom_ what does that work out as in sterling?
^Tom_ about 12?
^Tom_ 13
^Tom_ by the exchange rate, i don't remember how fair pp is, but i think quite
^Tom_ in radically different news, do you fancy joining me on a software project?
^Tom_ nick, someone i know but you don't
^Tom_ has made a board game
^Tom_ well, several... but one of them is kind of cool
^Tom_ picture a racetrack made of a square grid
^Tom_ and each player has a car and a little token
^Tom_ you may move your car anywhere within a 5x5 grid (excluding the corners) centered around the blob
^Tom_ BUT the change in position of the car is applied to the blob
^Tom_ erm, blob == token
^Tom_ so, if your car is at 0,0 and your token is at 2,0
^Tom_ then you can move your car to 4,0 for example
^Tom_ but then your token will end up at new car.position + car.delta
^Tom_ so the car moved (4,0) and is now at (4,0), so the token will goto (8,0)
^Tom_ so your next turn you can move to, for example 10,0 if you accelerate or 6.0 if you put the brakes on
^Tom_ if your token gets too far ahead of you, then you'll go off the track on the corners
^Tom_ basically the game follows a first order frictionless vector acceleration model
^Tom_ does that make any sense?
^Tom_ cheers
^Tom_ there's another 10 quid's worth i'd like to send somewhere at some point, but that can wait
^Tom_ ok
^Tom_ have you been keeping a rough tally?
^Tom_ http://iris.codescape.net/~tom/racegame.txt
^Tom_ when i get a mom, i'll try and write a specification for the game
^Tom_ the thing i'll probably struggle with most are:
^Tom_ a) generating a track other than just an oval
^Tom_ b) getting user input, and/or managing sessions if i do it via web
^Tom_ c) determining a winner, AND determining who's winning a race on an arbitrarily curved track
^Tom_ as the identity of the leader is significant
^Tom_ and d) collision detection on the walls of the track
^Tom_ if the track wiggles inwards, you can't cut it even if going from track to track, if the straight line between the 2 squares crosses grass, it's not allowed
^Tom_ other than that, you can help in your spare time if you want
^Tom_ or i'll let you know when something's half playable
^Tom_ help porting it to something like java or the like for a windows based frontend would be nice
^Tom_ although i might be really scanky and have a terminal based one and a javascript based one
^Tom_ it'll give me a chance to play with javascript

Ruth yup
Ruth been a couple of times
Ruth hehe
Ruth well yes it's really good
Ruth and you don't need upper body strength to climb properly
Ruth you should use your legs
Ruth though it has to be admitted a lot of men can get quite far on arm strength, but it's not technically good climbing
Ruth generally girls have to use more technique
Ruth hehe
Ruth i'm sure you have some arm strength
Ruth can your friend climb?
Ruth ah
Ruth well really you'd both need to know how to belay to go by yourselves
Ruth a group, or you may be able to pay for an instructor, but that'd be more
Ruth maybe contact bristol uni or UWE mountaineering clubs
Ruth i wasn't planning to im afraid

Jens how old is it Adam thinks the world is?
Jens they just found evidence of human activity from 700000 years ago in Norfolk
Jens that's fast
Jens I get 12MBps with the new adaptor going to my portable drive
Jens admittedly I'm also playing music off that drive
Jens what's in drama?
Jens you have all of the Wire
Jens can't see any west wing
Jens yes
Jens just watching beginning of skins series 3 and I recognise Bristol
Jens skateboarding down Park Street
Jens all of it eventually
Jens start with season 1
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yeah
Jens very nice
Jens is it HD?
Jens this skins is lol
Jens remind me in 2 weeks...
Jens can I dump stuff in your torrents folder when you're not here?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: um
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: i'm not sure i understand what you mean - please elaborate
Jens hmm they will be cycling on the path to Bath later in the series
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: after the download what initial owner:group and file permissions does such a file have?  ls -ld filename
Jens the iMac 27 screen is now available as a monitor: http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showthread.php?t=18113549
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: "drwx------" is a directory. What about the files?  ls -ld filename 
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: on your samba server, are you using "security = share" or "security = user"? testparm -vs 2>&1 | grep security
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: do the samba share(s) use "guest ok = yes" or do you use _real_ samba users, which you've configured with 'smbpasswd -a ...' ?
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: you posted "-rw-r--r--" being set for downloaded files. They are already world readable - so 'chmod a+rx' would only add the 'x' bits to the files. 
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: your posted "drwx------" for directories is much stricter, cause only the owner can 'cd' into such a directory
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: when your downloaded files already have "-rw-r--r--" being set, why do you think you need to chmod them at all ? 
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: just a sample where i assume you've exported a samba share with "path = /home/all_data" set. What does 'ls -ld /home/all_data' show? (Adapt the path spec to your own used path)
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: that's ok
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: btw - what samba version are you running? As root: smbd -V
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: what do you get with: testparm -vs 2>&1 | grep "guest account"   ?
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: and: testparm -vs 2>&1 | grep "map to guest"
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: and: getent passwd nobody  ?
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: then files with "-rw-r--r--" being set should be readable by your windows clients (coming in as guest users)
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: yep, i think so
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: newly created subdirs should be 0755
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: are subdirs probably your problem ?
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: you need both 'r' and 'x', 'x' allows to change into that subdir
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: it's a question how umask is set, when dowloaded sudirs/files are added ...
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: do you copy them over manually ?
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: are you using bash as your shell ? If so, what do you get with 'umask' ?
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: no
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: hmm, that will remove all "group" and "others" bits 
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: ... in case zsh's copy or move cmds are used
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: yep. Just try to create a dummy subdir. It should have drwx------
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: here with bash, i use umask 0022
#samba          kukks |  Haegin: np  :-)

Dave speek to you on saturday
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: New TV tracker, better than STR.
Jens hey; what was wrong with the server?
Jens ah
Jens you can try and have a go at generating map tiles
Jens Mapnik is the tile generator OSM use, and it has Python bindings
Jens I don't have an nvidia card though
Jens basically we want map tiles (bounded to the southern UK area) at the higher zoom levels (11+ probably) which only have coastlines and place names, and if possible showing the hill shading like on openCycleMap - though that is really not so straight forward
Jens anyway this Firefox is giving me errors now since Ubuntu is trying to update it so i'd better restart... have fun at work
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: Only for irssi.

SmoneP ok bye
emb jftr, MikeT broke up with me. has a moar different bf nao
emb if that hasn't come up in channel when I'm not around xP
emb tbh I'm pretty devastated and hoping he'll come round. we were polyamorous for a month or two beforehand, so I already had Liam to break my fall as it were...but bleh
emb I has moar different. he apparently can't cope with moar any
emb still living with Mike next year, so idk what happens. will be pretty weird anyhow
Gravis|Milan Yarp?
emb noep. he's from my YUSU LGBT clique :P
emb 2nd year philosophy student n.n
emb :P
emb I pretend to understand the logic things they do :D
Gravis|Milan From some of embs comments of late, I'd assumed
emb or if you're Maud, you accidentally the right answer without thinking about it >.>
emb or so I hear.
Gravis|Milan Also, the fact that MikeT comes across as being very sarcastic whenever he interacts with emb in that area.
Gravis|Milan Although that may just be me reading additional sarcasm in.
emb but yeah. Liam is a polyface (like the thing daelis0r have going on)
emb yup. It worked moar better when I had MikeT as well, but I'll live :P
Gravis|Milan See, I always said, I lurk, I don't idle.
emb you got house stuff sorted for next year yet?
Gravis|Milan The difference is slight, but there.
Gravis|Milan But meh.
Gravis|Milan None of my business anyway.
emb wewt
emb :D
emb yup
emb MikeT and I are practically living in the daehouse next year
emb which has similar potential
emb it's arranged slightly differently, so more spacious
emb yeah, possibly slightly bigger. but dining table is under the stairs and TV is against the windowdoors
Gravis|Milan True, true.
Gravis|Milan Well, you talk to emb more than I do
Gravis|Milan Which is why I thought I;d ask
Gravis|Milan That way, if you didn't know, you would be aware
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i think they pretty much all do now...
emb just us :)
emb I think it'll be fine
emb we've really not split acrimoniously...like I say I'm holding out on him falling for me again u.u
emb which I really can't see not happening at least a little bit in that environment
emb not like arrogantly...:P
emb he's depressed and needs space...but I think this might throw the happy things at him. which will be weird, but w.e :D
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you know what else is awesome?
emb :D
emb danke
emb in other ramblings: don't suppose you've heard from paul about your report recently?
Gravis|Milan Heh, google search for something random just came up with a link to biolpc22.york.ac.uk. XD
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: At their current machine or in general?
emb oh, ok
emb :P
Gravis|Milan Today?
Gravis|Milan Damn...nobody there to get it ):
Gravis|Milan Worth me running home at lunchtime, you think?
Gravis|Milan Okay then
Gravis|Milan True.
Gravis|Milan But I'd be able to tell you earlier if it was missed or not.
Gravis|Milan Actually, the last one went to the post office, didn't it?
Gravis|Milan Should be fine, then
Gravis|Milan Out of interest, what's with the sudden binge on converting from FLAC?
Gravis|Milan Ah, okay
Gravis|Milan Ah, thought so
Gravis|Milan Was gonna say, you're a huge FLAC fan, certainly more so than mp3
Gravis|Milan No, that's my only issue with FLAC
Gravis|Milan My Creative happilyplays both, but my phone doesn't.
Gravis|Milan Oh, do you want me to bring in other games next week?  For the funky 3Dness?
DaveLovingFB are you really on here of have you left it open on your computer

#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i have no idea,
#cs-york           Alan |  haegin: bug tracking without a webserver? tell them to stop beimg so lazy and get a server, or borrow from another dept...
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, lol
#cs-york  *          emb pokes Haegin w/ that suggestion
#cs-york        Helzibah hehe, good luck Haegin :)
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: it's what the comprec database isnt.

#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yeah
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i know
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: hence my serious suggestion of pwgen :P
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: no we don't. it's equally obscure in the sample space as any other suggestion!
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: but they shouldn't
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: especially as you can see who is downloading what from who....
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: it's more getting unwanted insights into peoples tastes...
#cs-york         sparky |  Haegin it hasnt been sent around yet as far as i know

#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, why?
#ylug         Carwash Hej Haegin.
#ylug        Carwash |  Haegin: You going to the social on Monday?
^Tom_ hi
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin, User_4574: one of 2 things i think:
^Tom_ hi
^Tom_ not too bad
^Tom_ what's the current state of play with the house?
^Tom_ i've signed, dave's signed, they have my guarantor's info
AndyR evening
^Tom_ and they now know the date that you'll be signing?
^Tom_ ... again.
^Tom_ approximately when?
^Tom_ and how was kenya?
^Tom_ k
AndyR dull at the moment, project work is crawling along, and as you can see, we're in on a friday evening
AndyR we're so rock and roll
^Tom_ we've paid them moneys, so i'm not sure why they care too much
AndyR hows things with you?
AndyR ah, the art of procrastination
AndyR nope
AndyR they are the saddest collection of people you could ever hope to meet
^Tom_ ok
^Tom_ if you want a bed, let me know before you come up
AndyR yeah, plus i get my geek quota filled by just being in the CS department
AndyR and living in a house with 3 other computer scientists
^Tom_ he's moved, aye.
AndyR I'm in High Kingsdown (north end of the uni campus, right before you hit redland)
^Tom_ with hopefully an exception of next weekend
^Tom_ yeah, jason and i had both accounted on the big room being free
AndyR http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=high+kingsdown,+bristol&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=23.173984,67.631836&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=High+Kingsdown,+Bristol,+Avon+BS2,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=16
^Tom_ then icr hopped between the rooms, rather scuppering our plans
^Tom_ so he's said he can go back for the day i think
AndyR where abouts are you?
^Tom_ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpCyoj1BTWw
^Tom_ watch that, it's a bit good
AndyR where abouts are you then?
^Tom_ no, jason and i want it separately
^Tom_ he's organising a concert and doesn't want to have to fork out for a hotel for the band
^Tom_ and it's chocfest (york's juggling & chocolate convention) the same day, and i'd said some people could crash the night
^Tom_ youtube-dl
^Tom_ and mplayer
^Tom_ k
AndyR yeah, a bit more than "just down the hill"
AndyR lol, then all uphill on the way back, so swings and roundabouts
AndyR but if it'll be easier to come to my place rather than go all the way to TM then lets go for that
AndyR tuesday is good
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: From The Show with Zefrank, http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/whipass/
AndyR I could come and pick you up in the car if you like, we go for a drink and then decide
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: im pretty sure its on janet
AndyR i can drive both ways if you like, i'm not expecting to get trashed - what sort of time is good for you?
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  haegin: Funny coincidence: I actually decided to give Dvorak a go today
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: yeah, the only thing I worry about is that it'll piss off anyone else who uses my keyboard if I keep the switch
AndyR there are a couple of nice places near me if you want to grab dinner
AndyR so if I come and get you at about 7
AndyR ok, cool, also is your mobile number still 07935902814
AndyR lol, fair enough
AndyR that sounds like a less than ideal situation
AndyR get a proper phone
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: yup
AndyR sounds like a lot of hassle if you ask me
AndyR anywho, tuesday it is, i'm going to the pub now, speak soon
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: i don't think that the WRG is > 100k CPUs ?
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: looking it up, i think that EGEE is 2 orders of magnitude bigger than WRG
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: juelich has a bluegene machine which is europe's only petaflop machine
^Tom_ holy crap
^Tom_ only 2 GB memory per quad core node
^Tom_ which works out at 144TB of RAM
^Tom_ the smallest unit of CPU time that you can request in a research grant is 1 rack month
^Tom_ each rack is 4096 cores
^Tom_ 72 racks
^Tom_ currently the 4th fastest machine in the world
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Which tracker?

^Tom_ 0,039 euros per node per hour on the petaflop machine, 0.39 euros per node for the other 2 machines
^Tom_ yup
^Tom_ the minimum amount  of the cheaper one is huge though
^Tom_ 1 rack month for the 0.039 euro per node per hour one
^Tom_ which is 1024 nodes * 730 hours
^Tom_ 3000 euros
#cs-york          BidMod perhaps we need to have a "Hacksoc game party"

[ICR] Oi
[ICR] can you add a db to hacksoc for me
[ICR] called pubcrawl
[ICR] :)
[ICR] is it done?
[ICR] yup
[ICR] so what would the username and password be?
[ICR] ok, I'll go check
[ICR] cheers
[ICR] by hacksoc user so you mean the hacksocsec?
[ICR] because I can only manage ajanuary and hacksocsec on my panel
[ICR] Is it possible to setup multiple people to be able to access the ftp?
[ICR] well I'd like permission
[ICR] the ones I use to login to the panel don't work
[ICR] what user did you give the permissions to?
[ICR] I don't seem to have access
[ICR] I can login
[ICR] but all i got i morethannothing stuff
[ICR] :)
[ICR] I'll just get Mike to upload it
[ICR] thanks for trying
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: bioshock works on linux?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: not hugely, but its still yet another factor to test
#cs-york            Alan curse you hacksoc!
#cs-york           MikeT yeah, but it doesn't matter so much if you miss the odd hacksoc thing, we try to do at least something every week
#cs-york            Alan which also clashed with a hacksoc thing
#cs-york            Alan I'm just ranting because i'm missing out on all the hacksoc socialising because it's clashing with much more epic events

#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: no :P
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i just approve of their business practices
Jens graphics card reminder
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: ping
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, nope
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: when you return to york, are you up for going for a weekend distance attempt?
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: like something crazy like 3-500 between friday evening and sunday evening
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: between 3 miles and 500 miles
^Tom_ i really meant 300-500, as you may have guessed
^Tom_ yeah
^Tom_ i think you probably could
^Tom_ having done 85 the other week
^Tom_ with a previous record of about 40
^Tom_ and the 85 was hilly
^Tom_ flat?
^Tom_ yeah, i thought as much
^Tom_ the hills make a mahusive difference
^Tom_ if you can keep up about 15mph for 30-40 miles then you can probably do 80-100+ in a day
^Tom_ anyway, i'm thinking about setting off on a friday evening over summer, doing about 40-50 miles or something, camping
^Tom_ then riding for most of saturday, stopping if there's something to see/do
^Tom_ (having turned around at eveningish)
^Tom_ and then ride home on sunday
^Tom_ with a railway bailout plan
^Tom_ probably about 300 miles
^Tom_ but it would easily be pushable to something crazily huge
^Tom_ maybe more like 200 tbh
^Tom_ to saltford via chew?
^Tom_ have you been tempted to ride home for the weekend?
^Tom_ it's only 82 from bristol to marlborough and back
^Tom_ but at some point i'd like to try some absurdly crazy rides
^Tom_ like 2 days of solid riding kinda thing
^Tom_ riding in all the current daylight hours would be about 120 on the flat, 100 with a small allowance for hills
^Tom_ well, s/daylight hours/starting at about 9:30/
^Tom_ so yeah 120 per day is doable with starting at dawn
^Tom_ well, 85 with hills didn't feel too draining
^Tom_ or even fit requiring
^Tom_ it just hurt my arse on my saddle
^Tom_ and i got cramp on the hills in my leg
^Tom_ but other than that
^Tom_ i've always found the 2nd day of walking not too bad
^Tom_ having marched 2 25 milers back to back
^Tom_ of a 4 day march, they say the beginning of the 4th is the hardest
^Tom_ erm, no
^Tom_ the beginning of the 3rd
^Tom_ the "i'm knackered, and i'm only half way there" feeling
^Tom_ the firlst day has the "woo, let's do this" feeling
^Tom_ the last day has the "wooooooo, let's finish this"
^Tom_ and the 2nd day is more like "tired, but could be worse, let's hope it's as good as yesterday"
^Tom_ yeah, i'm not asking for a commitment
^Tom_ but rather bouncing ideas off you
^Tom_ i think you'd be fine on a 100 miler on the flat in a day
^Tom_ like 6 hours of riding, 7 or so with breaks
^Tom_ so in 8 or 9 hours+
^Tom_ i've got a rack, has your bike?
^Tom_ is your bike a ribble audax frame?
^Tom_ audax should be able to take a panier easily
^Tom_ audax bikes are half way between racing bikes and touring bikes
^Tom_ what model did you get in the end, or was it a bike builder custom build?
^Tom_ yeah
^Tom_ if i were to get another bike, i'd look for somewhere between an audax style and a tourer
^Tom_ really?
^Tom_ you can still have fun on hills with a road bike
^Tom_ and i tend not to do too much muddy riding
Morganite oh will be back in marlbrough around the 9th
Morganite for like 5 days lol
Morganite around then i beleive yeh you be in marlborough?
Morganite ok :) defo sort something out
Morganite ok cool well maybe i will go to bristol and say hi lol
Morganite will tell you dates im back
^Tom_ punctures depend a lot on the tyres
^Tom_ eg good touring tyres are about the most resistent to punctures
^Tom_ true dat
^Tom_ i tend to just bomb down hilly roads
^Tom_ rather than hillsides
^Tom_ an XC hardtail, or cyclocross bike would be great
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: I can read it, but it's got some nonsense in it.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I totally saw the ae thing you had going on
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: Aterm fails, so I would presume xterm will as well.
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: They aren't strictly umlauts, I don't think.
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: I thought L was your special question symbol?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: aye, L instead of ? is definitely a Dvorak mark
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: not sure, but what i've realised is that i've started picking up touch-typed qwerty recently
Dave hey
Dave hey
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i think you can have a tv, aslong as you can prove its never connected to signal
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'm aware of this. It doesn't really change things too much.
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i know, also iPlayer can be viewed without a tv licence (not live)
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i know
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Some people wouldn't, nope.
#cs-york     prettygreat Hi Haegin
Dave ok 
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I am, I just have to keep poking Get iPlayer Automator in between messages ;)

#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It got the 720 one?
prettygreat Can't you get it from the .torrent file?
prettygreat And with scene stuff, you know it always is
prettygreat Scene stuff is each to cross seed
prettygreat You dont need to bother cross seeding on BTN though since it's ratioless 'n all

#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin:  i hate you...
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: could put it in Goodricke GCR - personally I plan to use it as a replacement CSCR
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: how do you domesticate a unix?
#cs-york          BidMod oh - while I remember - Haegin, (when) are you coming to york next term?
#cs-york          BidMod otherwise, we'd have to get out and walk between Goathland and Grosmont, which I suspect Haegin at least wouldn't mind - it depends who else tags along
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i found out, it is
#bash           Tramp !faq empty > Haegin
#bash        greybot |  Haegin: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/004 -- How can I check whether a directory is empty or not?  How do I check for any *.mpg files?
#bash          Tramp |  Haegin: use that technique in combination with find ... -exec bash -c '' _ {} \; - preferably -execdir, if you have GNU find
#bash          Tramp |  Haegin: then you do it wrong. Probably forgetting the nullglob option
^Tom_ hi
^Tom_ i've got an email from my mum about general house stuff
^Tom_ let me dig it out
^Tom_ she's said:
^Tom_ 1) who is lead tenant?
^Tom_ 2) do we know that we will have to cut the grass/hedges and cultivate the garden etc
^Tom_ 3) do we know that we will have to clean the windows
^Tom_ and some other stuff
^Tom_ 1) me, right?
^Tom_ yeah
^Tom_ it was 2 and 3 that are really the only interesting ones
^Tom_ 4 and 5 are for me
^Tom_ oki
^Tom_ it's worth checking though
^Tom_ they may vary the contract based on whether the house has a lawn mower already there
^Tom_ yeah, just a couple of things i thought i'd share that were her comments
^Tom_ erm, pass
^Tom_ oh yeah, i was going to say that it really shouldn't be too difficult
^Tom_ slow maybe, but not too tricky
^Tom_ nah
^Tom_ you can use find
^Tom_ find -execdir command; will run a command in the directory of the file
^Tom_ or basename and dirname together would also do it
^Tom_ oh, i'd have done a bash script with lame
^Tom_ tags are the only problem
^Tom_ but i'd still fancy my chances of setting the tags (i've done it before)
^Tom_ same
^Tom_ nn
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: you still up?
User_4574 hey

#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: was just curious as you reconnected to irc and appeared to be on facebook!
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: RepRap?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: someone made a 3D printer that prints sugar
#cs-york           x5315 that's what Haegin was talking about
#cs-york           [ICR] I predict Haegin will win
#cs-york  *        [ICR] bows at Haegin's feet
#cs-york           x5315 tommylommykins: nope, it's Haegin
#cs-york          DaveXi come on Haegin, I've got money on you
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i think i did it
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: It should be pretty easy to use and there should be numerous examples and much documentation. I'd suggest trying out some examples.
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Also, is there a weekend soon when you'll be in the area and can come to a housewarming event?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: I have no qualms with using closed stuff
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: I only wanted an image
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: It will be Holmes
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: how would a zoomable map be more useful? If you want a map map, click on the links
#cs-york           MikeT [ICR]: you totally not turned up to this hacksoc event
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: using google map links is also better for iPhone and Andriod phones :P
#cs-york  *      julian- grumbles at Haegin's face
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: guess what???
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: no, it's Android development :P
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah... trying to do real-time audio on a mobile platform, should be an interesting challenge
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i currently have a blurry red dot that follows the finger
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah, i'm jumping right in at the moment which means i'm still getting the hang of the general paradigm it uses
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i'll take a look
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: it does
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: how do you get out of insert mode?
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yeah, that's the other option
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: huh, it wasn'tworking...
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i think eclipse just became usable...
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: that means nicking the DirectX versions
#cs-york  *      julian- gives Haegin WebKit

#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin: yes, I am. Thank you :-)
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin: that [...|...] is reminiscent of something...
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin: ehn, the syntax messes with my mind for the moment
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: looks ok. The menu on the left could do with whitespace top and bottom, and the whole width should be a link, not just the text
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: unless the problem is extremely subtle, it works fine in Opera :)
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: 100% but padding left
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i don't think you need it
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i think you need a bit more padding at the bottom of the page
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'm really liking it

#ubuntu         thrope |  Haegin: i guess that'll take ages but i'll give it a try...
#ubuntu       Wackler1 |  Haegin  I got no sound what so ever... tried like 5 guides now. Still no beep. And the Error started between to boot ups without internetconnection updates or chnages to the system.
#ubuntu         itheos |  Haegin, no i did not. its my old password
#ubuntu       Wackler1 |  Haegin one sec looking it up..
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: is there a wrapper that can do it?
#ubuntu           lao5 |  Haegin: how? thanks
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: I am trying to install IBM Lotus Symphony on my 64bit Ubuntu machine ... I downloaded the .deb package and the howto is referring to the .bin one ...
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: no, there is none ...
#ubuntu          nucc1 |  Haegin, what permissiosn should i give it?
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: here is the info http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/help.nsf/GeneralFAQ#15
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: i am at step 4 ... however its calling for the .bin file
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: sudo -H ./IBM_Lotus_Symphony_linux.bin
#ubuntu           indus ah yes right Haegin jumped on that one
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: can I just use the .deb that I have in the place of the .bin?
ecm in terminal?
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: step 4 says to download the ISMP installer .. dunno what that is ... but the command to install is referring to the .bin package/file
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: can I use the .deb in the place of the .bin?
ecm Warning: /usr/share/gconf/schemas/*.schemas could not be found.
ecm Usage: gconf-schemas --[un]register file1.schemas [file2.schemas [...]]
ecm gconf-schemas: error: You need at least a file to (un)register.
ecm and also
#ubuntu       Wackler1 |  Haegin 3)
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: no, I am at step 4 ... I did everything else already
ecm everytime my firefox goes full screen it goes black
ecm yes ubuntu 9.10
ecm just installled today
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: the .deb I have is the actual Symphony suite
#ubuntu           lao5 |  Haegin: thanks! a little horrible to me
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin; so I should extract the .deb package ... can i extract it to anywhere?
#ubuntu           lao5 |  Haegin: but i dont know where to choose color.
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: oh ok ... so it does not make a diff if its .bin or .deb ... ?
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: I just don't want to break my system :)
ecm well..
#ubuntu          nucc1 |  Haegin, perfecto!
#ubuntu       anichols |  Haegin: It's a gamepad, similar in appearance to a PS2 controller, made for PCs, with a fan built into it to keep the hands from getting sweaty.
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: how do you force clear a terminal window?
#ubuntu          nucc1 |  Haegin, i can change the particular folder's owner to www-data, but without the -r flag on my home folder, it cant access at all
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: I did "man sudo" before and am stuck at the end of the manual
#ubuntu          nucc1 |  Haegin, :) i meant the "read" flag for "all users"
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: oh thanks ... hehe
#ubuntu          nucc1 |  Haegin, i didn't run the chmod with "-r"
#ubuntu           lao5 |  Haegin: thanks again. i got it..
#ubuntu          nucc1 |  Haegin, yes. and the home folder allows no access to "other" at all. that's why it was failing.
#ubuntu          nucc1 |  Haegin, so chmoding  "o+r" solves the problem.
ecm no
ecm damn it all
ecm it all worked when i had ubuntu 9.04
ecm nothing works in full screen
ecm not even a stupid wall paper
ecm im going back to my other pc which is running win 7
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin:  dpkg: error processing symphony_1.3-1hardy2_i386.deb (--install):
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: I guess the .bin is probably arch neutral ... or something
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: yes ...
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: ok ... looks like its installing ... still warns me though
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: ok it installed
#ubuntu       Wackler1 |  Haegin don't wanna bother you... but no idea with the sound problem eh?
#ubuntu       Wackler1 |  Haegin 3)
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: and it opened ... thanks a lot!
Gravis Tonight.
Gravis That's as much as I can say given trains
Gravis Don;t know and don't know.
Gravis Well, I won;t want food
Gravis If I get the late one
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: if a newer version comes out I should just be able to install the newest one and it should overwrite the old one ... right!?
Gravis I may not be getting the late one, it depends on lifts being available
Gravis I will do
Gravis I was planning to anyway
Gravis Me too, the way down was awful.
#ubuntu       zetheroo |  Haegin: fantastic ...

Dave work was fun and had a small task to do, whcih made time flight quickly
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, there is software for it iirc
Ruth busy
Gravis What Mindstorms?
Ruth yours?
Hoffi hello
Ruth :(
Ruth work boring?
Ruth bummer
Gravis I got that, but it doesn't answer the question
Ruth i've just been to the peaks climbing
Gravis NXT, RCX, Star Wars?
Ruth and got a job interview tomo
Ruth documentation does sound crap
Gravis Same one I have, then
Ruth sat till today
Gravis I have the barcode reader, star wars and RCX.
Ruth a summer placement with Thales hopefully
Ruth stu says hi
Hoffi good thanks
Hoffi how you finding it? 
Gravis Although the first two may have beenbo              , tualy.
Gravis *beem before the split, actually
Ruth i do indeed say hi
Hoffi why dull? 
Ruth also, ruth smells!
Gravis So they may officially be technic.
Gravis Lego split to Lego and technic, then technic split to technic and Mindstorms.
Gravis Yeah
Ruth also busy
Gravis Mindstorms do the sensors and motors stuff, like the barcode scanner and the star wars one
Gravis But as I said, they may be too early to be technic
Hoffi a segway? 
Ruth haha
Ruth its all good
Hoffi oh! I know what you mean
Hoffi oh
Hoffi maybe not so fun then
Ruth how much longer you at bae?
Hoffi true
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi so how come you get to ride a segway? 
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi makes sense
Hoffi i've got a new job
Hoffi From June I am a teaching assistant
Hoffi yep
Hoffi only found out the end of last week
Hoffi thanks- it is definitely going to be better than cleaning
Hoffi replacing because it will be full time
Ruth ruth again
Hoffi two- cleaning and invigilating
Ruth how long do you reckon i've known cath williams?
Ruth since i was about 14?
Ruth yup
Ruth cool
Hoffi no- no one invigilates any art exams 
Hoffi the teachers just watch
Hoffi Is that what Ellie is doing at the moment? 
Ruth i emailed her :)
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi the closest I get to that is cleaning the art rooms
Hoffi I often see Ellie wandering round
Ruth bummer
Ruth thanks, right back to stu now
Ruth buh bye
Ruth she's doing lots of boring stuff
Ruth i had to fill out a backcheck form for my job recently
Ruth most of it ended up being blank
Ruth they have their ways
Ruth :s
Ruth uni work
Ruth got my job offer not too long ago, so that's taken a load off
Ruth not particularly
Ruth same place as last summer
Ruth riskmetrics
Ruth in london
Ruth mostly
Ruth oh no, i meant my uni work isn't particularly interesting
Ruth not giving me enough time to answer harry!
Ruth :P
Ruth no, its pretty much my dream first job
Ruth well it sounds like i'll be off to redmond a few more times before the end of the year
Ruth and LA
Ruth oh i definitely want to live in london
Ruth for the time being
Ruth but after a year i can go where i like
Ruth my boss and most of the team are in geneva
Ruth so i'm teaching myself french
Ruth in case i move out there
Ruth well just round the office last summer, it seemed no one would speak english
Ruth just the general office hubbub
Ruth was in different languages
Ruth it was strange
Ruth 90% of the people there must have been from overseas
Ruth well they will speak english normally
Ruth but chances are there'd be someone they work with who speaks their native tongue

^Tom_ well that might be me
^Tom_ is it just the script?
^Tom_ or are there files there too?
^Tom_ i think i have the files, but the script should no longer work
^Tom_ if it does still work, that'd be immensely awesome, but i doubt it
^Tom_ chances are you got them from svn.dmi.me.uk/dotfiles
^Tom_ hmm
^Tom_ can you run find on it and email me?
^Tom_ aka a file list
^Tom_ oki
^Tom_ but yeah, pls don't delete it without running it by me
^Tom_ erm, videos of me with poi
^Tom_ i can't remember what the firey video looked like, but i /think/ it might have been one that sephy (perhaps) posted on fb
^Tom_ but yeah, if you could hang on to it or send it to me
^Tom_ heh

#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: http://mbed.org/users/User_4574/ <-- check out FLFsT
blore Hey
#cs-york        Pyritie |  Haegin: like I know how to do that
#cs-york        Pyritie |  Haegin: weeks, days, hours, minutes
blore Why do computers do dubious addion?
blore *addition
blore Not really Harry
blore More Fortran giving me 0 + 273.15 = 273.14999997
blore and then giving Judy 273.14999994
blore On the same run
blore But on her laptop
blore weird, isn't it
blore Here's a good question for you, which is faster: X*X or X²?
blore This one's taking you a very long time to answer
blore have a go
blore really, that's the only answer you could give that doesn't have a case for it
blore and thanks to York compsci that's (X*X .EQ. X**2)
blore unlucky, Harry
blore Answer is it really depends what compiler gets it
blore But they'll never be the same in terms of efficiency
blore Either X**2 will be lowest efficiency behind X/Y, ranking around X**X
blore Or it will have extra instructions covering it, making it just about as simple as it gets (cubed and squard is a basic + or - type task in this case)
blore ha ha ha
blore Nevermind, eh, HArry
blore mmm
blore There's other reasons
blore But you know what I like about you - you ask why, most people never do that
blore What kind of Computing do I favour?
blore lol - verry funny
blore I mean Computing, not gaming
blore Databases, keep going
blore That's a very thin end of a much larger wedge
blore Surely you remember my exploits with Folding Proteins?
blore No, never mind eh HArry
blore Off-day today?
blore Even that's thin compared to what I do write code to do
blore I meant are you having a bad day
blore grim
blore Failed Will Save vs. feeling under the weather
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: hell, we still get paid
blore But Folding is a good example of code that would matter about things like X**2 or X**3 vs. X*X or X*X*X
blore Because it runs a lot of cycles for each one, trillions of calculations
blore Now that would be telling you my secrets, wouldn't it HArry. Besides, more fun if you have a few guesses...
blore That would be a plan, but unless I could get a  bog load of subscribers to the new code, it would take up very well, nah....
blore ...far more advanced this
blore This removed the 'computer flaw' from conventional models
blore You see a computer has to know a few things about atoms in Folding.
blore Where it is in 3D space is one
blore It's energy is assigned to it in another case, from a random distrubution called a Boltzman distribution
blore There's a flaw in this method
Jens hmm the new budget offers monies to the UK computer games industry
Jens and they are funding an extra 20000 IT/science/maths uni courses
Jens (course places)
Jens and cider duty goes up 10%
Jens we need to buy a load of cider
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: you also get 6 more unreliable drives!
Dave I will be around to test map stuff properly at 930
Dave ok
Jens http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=162247&id=608225687&l=21ffcf9d8e
Jens interested in a VIA mini ITX Carputer?
Jens are you also interested in the TFT?
Jens touch screen
Jens he needs to think about it
Jens the screen is quite new so still worth a bit
Jens the VIA stuff is a few years old (!GHz or so IIRC) and is basically a self contained PC that's a bit thicker than a netbook but similar size
Jens :P
Jens 7" touchscreen
Jens not sure if it's wired into a van at the moment
Jens (there's a standard 240V power supply as well as the 12V DC one)
#cs-york           MikeT there's a solution Haegin
Jens may well be this screen: http://www.lilliputuk.com/index.php?pid=4
Jens http://www.aphotoeditor.com/2010/03/25/rare-joel-sartore/
Jens didn't realise how perfectly they folded up
Jens Samsung rock
Jens my brother had a second hand 214T monitor (the 4:3 version of mine) and it brole - they repalced it for free under warranty
Jens *broke
Jens even though he didn't prove he was the original buyer
Jens could buy a faulty one on ebay, and try and get them to replace it
#ubuntu        obiwan_ |  Haegin: you don't have to change it in every terminal, just in the .bashrc or analog zsh config file, in-terminal export is just for current terms, next ones will open well
#ubuntu          llutz |  Haegin: sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
#ubuntu          llutz |  Haegin: hrm, no. it should ask for the locales you want to install and in 2nd step the systemwide setting
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: I wish you could too! It will be busy. I should warn the neighbours, really.
##java  KermitTheFrag |  Haegin: you could display sample data if the field is empty in the paintComponent
##java  KermitTheFrag |  Haegin: if ( foo != null ) ?
##java  KermitTheFrag |  Haegin: no, null has no type
##java  KermitTheFrag |  Haegin: when checking for null, ALWAYS use primitive operators
##java  KermitTheFrag |  Haegin: not if you use a quick fail operator like &&
##java  KermitTheFrag |  Haegin: bear in mind that once the value has been initialized it might stay that way even if the user backspaces all the input
##java  KermitTheFrag |  Haegin: np
Jens only difference to default is the left date thing
#cs-york       elsington I need to elaborate on the junk food, Haegin

#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: RAID some ssds
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: definitely
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: but he's mostly intact and alive?
##java      mapreduce |  Haegin: The results will change maybe once every 5 minutes.

Gravis|Milan We still have internet, and we didn't lose power
Gravis|Milan I don't know.
Gravis|Milan But my lock would reset if we lost power, and it didn't.
Gravis|Milan *clock
Gravis|Milan The only thing they touched was the cable hanging across the corridor.
Gravis|Milan We checked
Gravis|Milan They taped it up.
Gravis|Milan So it doesn't hang.
Gravis|Milan Oh, okay
Gravis|Milan They didn't touch anything, then.
Gravis|Milan Unless they unplugged things in the loungs, without disturbing anything else that we can see.
Gravis|Milan The front one, bottom lock.
Gravis|Milan The door to the fuse box is still shut, too.
Gravis|Milan Not that I am aware of.
Gravis|Milan They just told us it was happening.
Gravis|Milan Just did the one check I didn't think of earlier
Gravis|Milan Is the lounge on a separate ircuit from rooms, kitchen, etc?
Gravis|Milan *circuit
Gravis|Milan If so, then they tripped the lounge, is my best guess.
Gravis|Milan I still couldn't see that anything in there had been moved, but the 360 had reset its clock, unless Jason never set it.
Gravis|Milan The 360 sets when you sign in to Live.
Gravis|Milan So it was set.
Gravis|Milan Now it isn't.
Gravis|Milan I checked the stuff behind the TV, but it doesn't look like it's been touched at all.
Gravis|Milan The door under the stairs is open, though.
Gravis|Milan I think there's a socket in there, isn't there?
Gravis|Milan Yes there is, and it's on.  I dunno if it was on before, but if it's on the lounge circuit, they probably tripped it.
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: hmmm, the laptop might be able to run the source engine actually...

SmoneP hey harry, I'm looking to go to scotland for some mountains this easter - would you be available/interested?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: one sec
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: go to http://svn.twitterfall.com
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: notice how it doesn't load
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: that loads fine for you
SmoneP ?
SmoneP hey harry, I'm looking to go to scotland for some mountains this easter - would you be available/interested?
SmoneP think facebook chat lost that
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: it properly loads?
SmoneP ah
SmoneP oh righty
SmoneP umm maybe around 5 days - depends on free time
SmoneP fair enough.  yeah - well I'm thinking that as scotland is a day travel each way it needs a few days to be worth it
SmoneP if I go that is - not sensible to go alone
SmoneP in process of trying to find ppl
SmoneP no worries
^Tom_ hopefully
^Tom_ what's the hybridish thing?
^Tom_ tbh my first year bike's frame isn't too bad
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: in fairness ,the degree of motor control needed to write with just a finger isn't instant either
#cs-york   LloydSparkes |  Haegin, typing is just as hard at that age
#cs-york  * tommylommyki agrees with Haegin
#cs-york        Pyritie |  Haegin: C#
^Tom_ yeah, it's worse than that, but the frame isn't too bad
^Tom_ have you seen any pineberries?

x5315 and the file sizes
x5315 you don't have to enter everything else
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi does that mean you are ill now?
Dave ok that might be new, but in the thrid one, you had to listern to them
Hoffi oh dear, that doesn't sound do good.
Hoffi was the concert enjoyable despite that?
Dave yeah they make nosie, that is noticable
JarnieFB I JUST LEARNED IF YOU TYPE IN ALL CAPS IT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE YOUR WROTE MORE.
Hoffi well it' snot too bad, then
Hoffi oh
Hoffi danegrous, that
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi I might be around on Saturday
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: lol, but not quite
Hoffi pub in the evening definitely
Hoffi um... well, last saturday when we went to thepub there was me, olivia, mark, laura, alison and oscar
Hoffi don't know if anyone else is back
Hoffi I don't know, he wasn't last weekend but that doesn't mean he won't be this weekend
Hoffi well, it is my last day of cleaning tomorrow so it is going realy well- I'm looking forward to it all being over
Hoffi have you been on that segway yet?
Hoffi yeah, I imagine it is more fun outside
Hoffi you looking forwrad to being back home?
Hoffi yeah, I was wondering about that
Hoffi how long would it have taken you?
Hoffi um... writing a play, a few theatre company things, hanging out with friends- normal things
Hoffi potentially
Hoffi we are going to have a read-through with the youth theatre and see what they make of it
Hoffi yeah, I hope they find it funny... it is menat to be a comedy
Hoffi what you been up to?
Hoffi oh
Hoffi whose concert was it?
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi i don't know 'em (surprisngly considering the great number of bands I know... )
Hoffi yeah, just making conversation. I am trying to find a bit of writing that I did before... at least I thought I had, I'm not so sure anymore. Might have imagined it.
Hoffi no- writing is going pretty well but I wanted to return to a project that I thought I had started but I can't find the documnet anymore so I might have to just start again
Hoffi I don't know what it is called
Hoffi i don't remember clearly what that was either
Hoffi i don't think I named the main character in the first part
Hoffi i don't know when I wrote it either... you can see why I am wondering if I imagined this
Hoffi Don't know, it's up to you, really
Hoffi you think I am more decisive?
Hoffi good
Hoffi i haven't changed in that respect
Hoffi what season are you on?
Hoffi I have watched season 1-3 and have season 4 and 5 lined up to watch in teh near future
Hoffi yeah, vaguely
Hoffi I see
Hoffi so...?
Hoffi no, he is at his grandparent's house for Easter
Hoffi you really want to meet him?
Hoffi not really
Hoffi he just wasn't around when you were
Hoffi several people have met him
Hoffi no
Hoffi you are just in Marlborough a lot less than some people
Hoffi I know
Hoffi it has been purely coincidential that he is often away when you are around
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi I'm usually busy at weekends
Hoffi when you work in the week the weekends seem to soon disappear
Hoffi so you can be back at uni? 
Hoffi not so good
Hoffi would you usually hang out with your housemates when in York?
Hoffi I suppose
Hoffi getting much D&D in?
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi that sounds like quite a bit
Hoffi I guess
Hoffi so you play more if you could?
Hoffi it's ok
Hoffi I don't mind
Hoffi nah, friends always moan at each other. You, however, seem to have escaped my moaning.
Hoffi no?
&bitlbee @          root jabber(haegin@chat.facebook.com) - u756610999@chat.facebook.com just accepted your authorization request
Hoffi we didn't talk to each other that much
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi I don't really remember, to be honest
Hoffi it all seems a long time ago now
Hoffi now you are going to have me saying the inevitable ' I can't beleive how old we all are.'
Hoffi i really can't beleive it, though
Hoffi uni people think you are old?
Hoffi yeah but you are like a year younger than me
Hoffi probably
Hoffi sometimes I feel mega old
Hoffi it's when I am talking to Sam and suddenly I notice that I am not eighteen anymore
Hoffi scary
Hoffi I know
Hoffi no, he is still 18
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi not 19 until May
Hoffi I guess so
Hoffi he only left school last year
Hoffi no
Hoffi I think I did imagine it
Hoffi or i wrote it and didn't save it
Hoffi i think that was it
Hoffi bit annoying because I can't remember what I wrote anymore
Hoffi but I thought I read it to mum
Hoffi probably not
Hoffi i read her a lot of things
Hoffi you enjoying House?
Hoffi I see
Hoffi i'm watching 'Don't Tell the Bride'
Hoffi a tv programme on BBC iplayer where the groom has to arrange the whole wedding without the bride having any say or knowing anything
Hoffi well, how tired do you feel?
Hoffi oh! I remmeber that episode
Hoffi defiitely remember it
Hoffi how do you know the synopsis?
Hoffi yeah, it is a good episode
Hoffi sounds it
Hoffi there is a good twist
Hoffi um... let me see how much more of this programme I have left
Hoffi 40 mins
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi no?
Hoffi I only remember the main one
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi i imagine that's her
Hoffi that's what always happens in House in tehopening sequence
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi I remember
Hoffi probably just as well
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi no
Hoffi but quite often tv poeple don't
Hoffi what about Cameron?
Hoffi see
Hoffi what is Castle?
Hoffi I don't know these things
Hoffi nope
Hoffi people keep telling me I should, though
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi oh
Hoffi weird
Hoffi was it a mistake?
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi ok
Hoffi who is chuck?
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi you rate tv programmes in terms of hot girls?
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi you do realise that I am not really interested in hot girls, don't you?
Hoffi not really
Hoffi nope, don't want to either
Hoffi not really my thing
Hoffi too teenaged
Hoffi I suppose
Hoffi ok
Hoffi well, just finished my comedy play about juvenile deliquents being forced to be cleaners to clean up thier acts, still writing Pearce and I have a fantasy story idea but that is the one I've lost
Hoffi not really
Hoffi Pearce is the best
Hoffi well, I think it is
Hoffi ok....
Hoffi you too
Hoffi I guess I will be having a lie-in tomorrow....
Hoffi i know
Hoffi it's ok
Hoffi it's like it always is
Hoffi it's real
Hoffi it's the wedding day now
Hoffi she knows she is getting married
Hoffi she knows he is planning it from teh start
Hoffi it is only the details that she doesn't know
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi there you go
Hoffi that's the twist
Hoffi time for bed now,  I think
Hoffi g'night

#what.cd          zhaan |  Haegin: that's what i'm asking :P
#what.cd          paceee thanks Haegin.
#what.cd           V4mp |  Haegin, that sucks
#rtorrent      Kuifje111 |  Haegin: what.cd?
#what.cd        SierraX |  Haegin: or just change the ip in /etc/hosts and wait for the tracker to update.
#what.cd       andrew92 |  Haegin: probably
#what.cd           zhaan what Haegin said about redirecting would probably work, but i already restarted rtorrent :P
#what.cd     Bluebus112 |  Haegin, the server time or the page load time?
#rtorrent           geck |  Haegin: ya.. I had to restart mine when a favored tracker changed IPs this weekend
#Netfilter          bc547 |  Haegin: look in the manpage for -j DNAT

#rtorrent          ZoFreX [21:09] <Haegin> hi, how do I flush rtorrents dns entries for trackers? < you too!
#rtorrent      Kuifje111 |  Haegin: oh wait. what editing the hosts file?
#what.cd +        FZeroX oh hai Haegin
#what.cd      truefalse |  Haegin: Shall do
#what.cd            Psy |  Haegin, audacity definitely re-encodes to mp3 though
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: not Mac, iPad :p
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: To be clear, I mistakenly assumed that x5315 would have inferred from the context having been the iPad following on from the iPhone, that when I said "it's a device far more aimed at content creation" I meant that it was far more aimed at contention creation *than the iPhone* is. Thus me citing the iWork apps, the keyboard dock etc., as they're all things that didn't exist, and still do not exist, for the iPhone.

#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, any app that is for non public use i would suspect
#cs-york           MikeT you don't qualify Haegin
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: more SEI work :)
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh, as in pressing the home button twice
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i think you're confusing double clicking with right clicking
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: they've added regex into Cocoa, apparently
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh, Cocoa has never had regex
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: while i would agree that that would usually be a bad thing, all of the current methods are so horrendous that they need something better...
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, Alan its not microsoft doing it, its just a guy from microsoft doing i
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you running Lucid yet?
#cs-york   Sparkesinator Alan, Haegin still its aimed more at Developers from what i've read
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i don't think it is
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: adding repositories can be sooooo simple
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, alot of projects dont build dedicated .debs for each OS, which means you have to build from source
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: exactly
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: and also coappinstall://unique-application-name
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html they dont have ubunto .debs to download, theirs a few back port repos, which barely work, so you have to use source
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, you know you can fully automate MSI's, you dont need the license agreement
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, thats massively out of date
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, its now Mono 2.6.3
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, what version will ubuntu 10.04 have?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, but what if your running a server, and are not using any of those apps
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea which is the issue
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, im saying they should keep their repos up to day, any Mono 2.4 app should run fine on Mono 2.6
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, you can have both
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, and you pointed out the flaw in alot of FOSS , you only get what you pay for
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I would if I knew the filename... They've hidden it behind some (broken ) javascript thing
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, :wq, nano <filename>, <down key>x161
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: If vim can do it, it'll involve dubious macros probably.
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: that makes sense then
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yes, but it has no relevance here...
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i'm playing with Lucid in a virtual machine
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: I'd rather not risk finding out what happens when you ksplice while running software raid5
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: I know how to get the job done.
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yes it has issues, but linux has far more
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Sit my mum, or any other computer noob in front of a windows machine and a linux machine
#cs-york +         Maud |  Haegin: give a mac user these days linux and they'll find it vaguely ok :P
#cs-york +        x5315 |  Haegin: i'm not sure that +m works on Freenode
#cs-york +        x5315 |  Haegin: and -m?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: but he totally provoked me!
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Yeah..
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, that would be the hard bit
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, its not what it can or cant do, its the workflow
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i could never workout how to create project
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: ..And your computer then runs as fast as its hard disk?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, oh i still hate the fact it doesnt have an installer
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, what would i complain about?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i wouldnt
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  haegin: But no!
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: OK
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: yeah, it does feel nicer to type
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: of course my keyboard, I was Dvoraked before most of you young 'uns ;P
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: but that's because vim is sensible
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: how do you mean?
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: how do i do :new but vertical?
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: Emacs uses them too (with Ctrl), I just don't use them
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yhea
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: it's a Mozilla site
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin, The beast below
Sparkesinator ok unban me now

Jens http://yvettesbridalformal.com/index.htm
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: :D
Jens the worst website in the world?
Jens http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8612825.stm hmm not so good
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: idk about Java, but the STL (C++) lets you define your own hash functions where you want to
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin: for me, it's the other way round
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: are you paying us for that? :)
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: nah, GTS deal with that kind of shiz. several times removed from me :3
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: so as far as confidentiality allows...what's the most technically challenging stuff you've gotten your hands on? sanitised as appropraite, obv
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: mm?
#cs-york       blue_rose MikeT, hows hacksoccy adminy ratification thingy going?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: know any C?
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin: 'cause i'm not a student innit
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I was pondering a "code club" in a sort of book club format. like everyone reads a given piece of code and discuss it for whatever merits it has
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: true. you extending at BAe over Summer?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: did I mention I have an internship with Leandro Indrusiak? :
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: "Mapping data flow programs to multiprocessor platforms"
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: it was. 10 week internship = more time than a 3rd year project, in theory
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: s'what I thought. also a good first step on the PhD ladder :)
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: true, I totally missed the total
emb 2 years? I thought you knew me! ;p
emb ~£12k seems "normal"
emb so
emb £220/week
emb bet that doesn't add up...
emb just over £11k p/a then :P
emb 'cept I think taxes on bursaries might be different. I need to check that
emb web stuff?
emb looked at the department's internships dropping into your inbox? there's one on optimising GPGPU algorithms
emb shame there aren't other RTS ones going so far as I know, they like Java :P
emb but I see the money point
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: it's an assembler
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: so you take a code sequence and it has a literal "a + b" => "add r1, r2" sort of translation
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I'm only *half* joking
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: bah
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: poured salicylic acid on it
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: not really. when it's working effectively, it breaks the fucker down
emb lol, I was totally trying to avoid explicitly mentioning bodyfail around such cuteness as davex xP
emb I'm not *reallllly*
emb s'no biggie anyway
emb cute fresher who went a bit above and beyond the call of group huggery at pancakes + boardgames :3
emb now now
emb he only fondled me MILDLY inappropriately
emb whaddya mean "what happened"?
emb nonono. just with me :p
emb but has two other partners
emb neither of whom is miket
emb yeah :)
emb bah. he's still in my picture ¬¬
emb I'm just not really in his x.x
emb we're living together next year. if SOMETHING doesn't happen...
emb plus, it's tearing me to fucking shreds. he can't not ://
emb xD
emb not how we work, really
emb that's more likely to yield DaveXi related funtimes :p
emb :3
emb nah, she's very taken.
emb plus, there's a friggin' huge queue...
emb yeah. I need less jawline and more boobs before my queue happens ¬¬
emb very, very few afaik
emb well, I'm still "male" at work
emb and extended family don't know
emb but I'm fulltime at home as of very recently
emb so woo
emb I'm thinking cute freshers this year = TOO YOUNG ;p
emb unless they're gap year types :3
emb I sees
emb DaveXi is my brother's age. that terrifies me
emb how come?
emb true
emb and hardcore academics can't possibly be cute ;p
emb as someone who doesn't do preference all that heavily, I generally have to hope I'm the right gender for them \o/
emb :p
emb trufax
Hoffi oh- I'm actually just off to bed now
Hoffi it being half one
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi goodnight
x5315 hey
x5315 can i have my ops back yet :(
x5315 um
x5315 oh
x5315 i wanted to change the topic
x5315 tbh, yeh
x5315 lol
x5315 it's because i abuse it :p
x5315 tbh, i don't abuse it so much
x5315 like, sometimes, all i do is op
x5315 i don't /always/ kick people
x5315 but
x5315 topic permission should be fine :)
x5315 hey
x5315 i'm bored
x5315 so i'm going to go fishing for compliments :p
x5315 http://twitterfall.com/featurepage.html
x5315 tell me how awesome that is
x5315 also, be sure to look at the source code for it, to truly understand the brilliance of it
x5315 yeh
x5315 but not just that
x5315 but notice how there's no images in the main content
x5315 and there's no navigation list
x5315 yeh
x5315 oh
x5315 but if you really want some fun
x5315 http://twitterfall.com/features/script.js
x5315 look at the bottom
x5315 yeh
x5315 lol
x5315 want to know what's crazy
x5315 as long as you do that
x5315 it works
x5315 yeh
x5315 yeh
x5315 i'm so pro at regex :p
x5315 escaping?
x5315 oh right
x5315 yeh
x5315 well, yeh
x5315 JS is the best language ever
x5315 yeh
x5315 holy crap
x5315 i've just been talking to this guy about Twitterfall
x5315 like telling him when we've got bug fixes done and stuff
x5315 he asked me if i'm going to Chirp (twitter's conference)
x5315 turns out
x5315 he works there.
x5315 wtf.
x5315 Twitter.
x5315 http://twitter.com/Magnuson
x5315 i had no idea
x5315 yeh
x5315 i am
x5315 the company is paying :p
x5315 nope
x5315 cause he sucks
x5315 well
x5315 "he's busy"
x5315 basically
x5315 Toni.
x5315 oh
x5315 i wish i could go work at Twitter doing UX stuff
x5315 that idea can fuck right off
x5315 i know
x5315 and i'll need a job
x5315 it starts on Wednesday
x5315 yeh
x5315 i'm flying out on Tuesday
x5315 first time on a plane on my own
x5315 um
x5315 Heathrow to SFO
x5315 yeh
x5315 10 hours
x5315 nah
x5315 iPhone
x5315 on Airplane mode
x5315 iPad on the way back :p
x5315 it's cheaper to buy one over there
x5315 nah
x5315 just the one
x5315 the base model is $500
x5315 which is like £330
x5315 yeh…
x5315 and it'll definitely be more when it comes out here
x5315 just to point out
x5315 the company is buying that
x5315 yeh
x5315 one for me and one for jal
x5315 although
x5315 he'll get his when they come out in the UK
x5315 um
x5315 not really
x5315 in terms of the business, we've kind of totally stalled
x5315 oh
x5315 some of the stuff i'm about to say is quite...
x5315 mmm
x5315 keep it under your hat kind of stuff, yeh?
x5315 mainly, i think, because of Toni
x5315 her mum died last summer
x5315 so, she's a greater burden on him than she was before
x5315 they're living together in York now, because she doesn't really have anywhere else to stay
x5315 which means i hardly see him
x5315 and because of the time drain she is, he hasn't had much time
x5315 without sounding to harsh
x5315 but the opening paragraph of this: http://blog.twitterfall.com/embracing-html5
x5315 is truthful
x5315 yeh, well, actually
x5315 well, it depends what you mean by backend
x5315 just bear in mind, that all the features mentioned in that blog post only added 100 lines of javascript
x5315 and the reason for that
x5315 is that i rewrote massive portions of it
x5315 erlang doesn't anymore
x5315 erlang sucks
x5315 Scala :p
x5315 basically
x5315 imagine Erlang you can actually program!
x5315 like, all the advantages of Erlang are in Scala
x5315 but Scala has a java/php/C/js style syntax
x5315 in what sense?
x5315 um
x5315 it runs on the JVM
x5315 which means you can import any libraries from Java into it
x5315 but, it's Java without all the extra boilerplate
x5315 like in Java
x5315 clock Clock = new Clock
x5315 var clock = new Clock
x5315 i mean, obviously it's a clock
x5315 what do you think new Clock returns.
x5315 lots of type inference
x5315 and other inference like that
x5315 um
x5315 i can't remember the exact syntax
x5315 but
x5315 var foo = HashMap.empty[String, Int]
x5315 	val Searches = Map.empty[String, Scheduler]
x5315 that's qupte
x5315 basically, it gives you an empty Map
x5315 i think that's the constructor for a map
x5315 well
x5315 that's what i've been using
x5315 http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/tags/R_2_7_7_final/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/Map.scala?view=markup
x5315 yeh
x5315 line 23
x5315 oh wow
x5315 so it turns out that a Map is a hashmap by default
x5315 but Scala also has the actor model for concurrency
x5315 the easiest bit of this being that the creation of threads is stupidly easy
x5315 doThis
x5315 actor{ doThat }
x5315 doThat will be in a different thread to doThis
x5315 i mean
x5315 oh, btw, you can have methods defined like that (with no parameters and therefore no parentheses)
x5315 def func{ val x = 1 }
x5315 just getting rid of more boilerplate
x5315 tbh, i don't think my Scala is very good
x5315 i think i write it very javascripty
x5315 but the language has potential
x5315 lol
x5315 mmm
x5315 sounds cool
x5315 not as it currently is
x5315 yeh…
x5315 yeh
x5315 anyway
x5315 i'm gonna head to bed now
x5315 night

Dave HEY
Jens wtf http://static.arstechnica.com/2010/04/12/IP_address_text.png
Dave sorry had caps on
Dave how is you
Dave cool 
Dave when are we playing this weekend
Dave well I am free this week, not sure depend if you want to run a long on
Dave ok then saturday might be
Dave cool
Dave where do you think you put zombie land on my drive as i can not find it any where
Dave well it look like you miss it off
Dave cool
Dave now I am starting to make the plot from my traveller game, and what would you perfer, a save the world type game, A lost in space\farscape style game or a serenty type game
Dave well the film lost in space, so you start with a star ship and get lost in space, in an unknow envoriment, or in an unknow tech level
Dave yeah so doing job to surviling in a know gallexy,  or explorering  an unknow gallexy and trying to survil but is hard as you need a good amount of skills
Dave why do you think maxed careers
Dave ok I understand for the lost campian i was not short for the year long one
Dave yeah, just you might need one person to have lots of careers so they have the money to afford a ship
Dave also would you want to be captain
Dave brb
#cs-york           ^Tom |  Haegin: {1..5} works in bash
Dave i am back
Dave my plan was to let you take 3 careers and the 1-2years worth of training and making of money
Dave then give you an ally how work for you as well
Dave with the idea that you loose all your moeny from the years and gain a ship we design that is serval years old from a dealer
Dave and the you hire the team
Dave ok and do you thick that i should allow you to have one high rolled stats
Dave no you have one stat that you nomiate and roll 3d6 and the rest you roll nornal
Dave so it is a bit of a gamble
Dave ok cool
Dave ok
Dave I will speak to you again at some point

Marc ah kk
Gravis|Milan Tried deleting it in the end...it was futile. )':
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: hahahahahahahahahaa
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: disagree
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: the problem with the cyclists is 90% of them disregard the rules of the road entirely
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: I would have no problem with cyclists dominating the road, and filtering down the outside
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: I don't care about money
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: my insurance was ~200
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, it is
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, what language you using?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, ok
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i've never done that in IIS
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, this might hep you http://custombasicauth.codeplex.com/
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, fairr does
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin: no
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: im looking at it now
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: yes.
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: shush :P
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: as far as dave is concerned "time" is the correct time to sleep.
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin, excellent topic
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: are you sure there isn't a 'skip this question'
AndyK cool
AndyK have you decided on xp from the last session yet?
AndyK last you told me was that you'd get back to me about it and that i'd get a bit extra due to my exciting rescue attempt
AndyK looks like I'm presently on 13070
AndyK i believe so
AndyK but the cleric died and the mage fled, so technically we succeeded in defeating them
AndyK that whole situation is a bit tricky. if you go strickly by the rules, then the only player to get any xp from that encounter would be me as I was the only pc conscious at the end. Forcing an enemy to withdraw or flee is still considered a defeat. However, I have always disagreed with this stance.
AndyK all the players involved in the combat should get xp.
AndyK unless they died which in this case they didn't.
AndyK since the mage was also victorious, not b/c he survived but b/c he captured two of the players, he should also get xp
AndyK the question becomes whether anyone actually did damage to the mage
AndyK i thought i did but may be misremembering
AndyK if he was dmged then i'd award the players partial xp for him
AndyK if he had dmged me, which he didn't, then he'd also get partial xp for me
AndyK plus the full xp for defeating sarah and dave
AndyK so like i said, its a tricky situation
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: i'd grab what you want from mordor, cause (probably after tsp) im gonna put gentoo on it
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: which chirp?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: http://twitter.com/x5315/statuses/12133516102
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: as in sold out yesterday
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh.
Dave hey how is you

Dave who does this route look
Dave http://www.contours.co.uk/walking-holidays/two-moors-way.php
Dave just walk it
Dave it is about a mile
Dave 100
Dave thats the holiday, the route is about a 100 miles
Dave 6. Devon Coast to Coast Walk - a varied and attractive 104-mile (166.5 Km) route from Plymouth or Wembury on the south coast to Lynmouth on the north coast through the National Parks of Dartmoor and Exmoor. Read more  
Dave  thereare some idea
Dave http://contours.co.uk/
Dave 70miles
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I saw one today. A real one!
Dave we took 5 days of walking plus a day off, didnt we to do the 70
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I didn't see it with my hands. It was sat on someone's desk being mucky
Dave no that was  harderds wall
Dave I am think 10 days maybe with two days rest
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: it was switched off, he wasn't there, I was working with someone on something :p
Dave we can also start from Ivybridge
Dave yeah, that should cut off10-20 miles off the start
Dave making a bit more like harriedens walk plus some
Dave starting from Ivybrigde is 89 miles, so 8 days and is on one famuos path(two Moor Way) and the ivybridge, is 15 miles on the Erme Plym trail
Dave so an extra day
Dave I have an antue how lives in plymouth how we might be able to stay at on the first night and start wlaking eraly
Dave but she might be a bit off course
Dave so we can do the whole trip
Dave yeah it should be fun
Dave I should be ok to start at three on saturday as well
Dave I will ok with that, or i can just watch it the day after on i player
Dave ok I will see you then
emb no.
emb no
emb I need to stab maud with fucking razorblades

#cs-york           MikeT how would you know Haegin
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: you say the sweetest things.
#cs-york  *         Alan dons Haegin's hat
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Being stuck with them, as well as Kilroy Silk, who can only be seen and heard by you.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: You don't remember?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzZ86GYoxE0
emb I'm fucking sick of this

#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: not sure that would help too much with apps that suck at multiple monitors...
#cs-york           stewb [23:24:58] <Haegin> AIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!1111ONEONEONE
Alan yo

Alan maybe you know moar about your year than I do
Alan but are emb and miket not an item?

emb I wish Maud and lis0r had never fucking joined the channel
Alan but they were, right?
Alan right
Alan yeah
Alan I guess i missed the part where they became unitemed
emb I have him on MSN
Alan but i was wondering as much, since MikeT is mean at her now
emb but it doesn't work
emb he's too much of a coward to talk about things
Alan which i'm pretty sure he didn't used to be...
Alan i would agree
Alan yeah
emb I'm seriously considering not going back to York
stewb Is this some long term feud I've missed?
emb he's on leave of absence
stewb I've been away 3 hours and nothing seems to have happened
emb we have a house together.
emb I want everything to be ok
emb but I can't face it not being
stewb Fair enough, I will shut up
emb other than killing myself? no
stewb Not a problem
emb I can barely stand the thought of not being with him, never mind not living with him at all
#cs-york          MikeT |  Haegin: or I'll be swallowed in your blaze of righteousness? gee. quaking in my boots.
emb no
emb that was a tad far...
emb banning on the first kick :p
emb try?
emb we're good together. and we will be
emb it's ok
emb :p
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: it's alright
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: http://twitter.com/chloes
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: um, i dunno
emb nope
emb but meh
emb I talked to Maud and calmed down
emb :)
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: right
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: are you watching?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: well, Ev just lied :p
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: this is the first
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, true
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: ahaha @ "people who knit their own yoghurt"
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i don't have to worry about such petty things, i'm not eligible to vote anyway :(
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: exactly
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: Just So Stories?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: no
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: mv
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: which one in particular?
jarnie Omg
jarnie Do you watch south park?
jarnie Just watched 200th episode. Funniest. Episode. Ever.
jarnie Was crying :P
jarnie Their aim was to piss off as many celebrities as possible, and the whole thing about Mohammed
jarnie Seeya
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: that's a programmer bug, not a Java bug :P
Jens http://www.itv.com/electiondebate/ live at 8.30
x5315 hey
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: PM
x5315 hey?
x5315 do you have a copy of your CV i can look at?
Jens why did the internet sudden;y speed up?
Jens yeah it wasn't just as I typed the message
x5315 hey
x5315 if you sent me a link or anything
x5315 i didn't get it
Jens just about to start
Jens terrible connection though
Jens they have a 500 internal server error
Jens not on the stream though
Jens reloaded and it's working ok now
Jens I think it had problems because it went out of sync
Jens hmm they have a chance to respond to each other and the labour/conservatives only answer each other's arguments and repeat the lib dem as if his ideas are their own
Jens obviously there are distinctions
Jens Barry Kirby at work is running for a seat....
Jens for Gloucester Council
Jens please somebody ask about the DEB
Jens oh dear my brother dropped his phone in the canal...
Jens yes
Jens doubt it was insured
Jens no, his gf lives on one
Jens it probably fell out of his pocket
Jens Brown just said that he would make the House of Lords elected - so that would get rid of Mandy
Jens Clegg says we should be able to sack our MPs if they are corrupt
Jens and both are trying to get Clegg on their side
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: fair enough. round here there are plenty
#cs-york  BarneseydNBoo |  Haegin: 'slightly more than half time'
#cs-york  BarneseydNBoo |  Haegin: 0.33, 0.66, 1?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ? :|
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: which party?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: constituency only makes sense when the constituencies are autonomous in practically all respects
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: "Choose hope over fear?" Oh, Christ. He so wants to be Obama. I wouldn't be surprised if he blacked up for the next one.
#cs-york        Pyritie |  Haegin: BarneseydNBook: I'm in the US; had to help my grandma with gardening stuff outside
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: sure i can...
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: that's a fucking cool idea
#cs-york        Quendus |  Haegin: how unfortunate for the people doing safety critical systems
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: According to Timmis (and I agree) as an IDE, it teaches OO reasonably well
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: But yeah, BlueJ is designed for teachine
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: yeah
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: do you tend to modify other people's code or write new stuff?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: yeah
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: I'd love to have been able to organise something like that with Hacksoc
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: problem you have there is people not being confident in knowing things :p
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: yes
#cs-york          [ICR[ |  Haegin: says you. I'm totally authoritative
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I dunno
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: surgically remove peoples egos?
emb lol.
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Indeed
#cs-york        Quendus |  Haegin: yeah, just put a temporary ban on the staff_bot while we sort out a common solution for each open assessment...
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: But in Open assessments, it's a block to much communication
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I'm sure more people would feel more comfortable with assembly if we hadn't had the rock and a hard place of em80 and just burning to ROM
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: an assembler with genuine error messages and a debugger that doesn't require you to walk over broken glass to start a program would be nice :(
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: yes!
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Yes... three outputs, but I can only use any combination of two :s
#cs-york        Pyritie |  Haegin: I don't even think it stopped
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Does the contents of mailing lists get preserved, like in forms?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I meant a stackoverflow ripoff
#cs-york        Pyritie |  Haegin: yeah they keep pushing it back because they don't know
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: elaborate?
##java           tofi |  Haegin: no
#cs-york  *     daeghnao waves Haegin

Dave but the one i play 4 years ago had a hoover craft
Dave some where on the canal system
Dave ok i am running around dodgeing the helicopper
Dave yeah
Dave ok
Dave that good
Dave have you done the medel chanellege of the portel 
Dave ok i tryed a few of them and some of medals are redickuless like the seats

Dave yeah they just seem redickuless like the nuber of portal in 2
Dave yeah i know
Dave ok i am running out of power, so I will speck to you on skype in an hour
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: oh, you're funny
Hoffi ok
Hoffi u?
Hoffi how come?
Hoffi I see
Hoffi You been watching more House?
Hoffi For someone who goe son about twitter so much you don't tweet very often
Dave hey
Hoffi oh ok
Dave ok
Hoffi oh ok...odd
Dave yay
Dave ok
Dave why
Dave cool
Hoffi ah ok, that makes more sense now
Dave you up for skype
Hoffi really?
Hoffi You don't tweet hardly at all
Hoffi I know
Hoffi i've been following you for the past week
Hoffi at least
Hoffi i've recnetly got into it
Hoffi it was really fun last night with teh debate
Dave ok
Hoffi nope
Hoffi it looks confusing
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi I have just about worked out hwo to use normal twitter i don't want anything more compliacted
Hoffi nah
Hoffi i'm happy as I am
Hoffi ok
Hoffi nope
Hoffi all very recent
Hoffi I decided I am going to have time on my hands while I wiat for my new job to start so I decided to start a blog and make a twitter account
Hoffi no one reads the blog really but I still write
Hoffi * write it
Hoffi Oh ok
Hoffi it's good writing practice anyway
Hoffi nope
Hoffi I don't mind that much
Hoffi it is probably better nor to know
Hoffi eh?
Hoffi oh, I see
Hoffi I'm guesisng it is geeky, though
Hoffi ok.... that is still a bit geeky
Hoffi ah, but I odn't talk about it
Hoffi I don't write about being on google
Hoffi so the content is not really that geeky
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: Twitter, yep.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: according to big companies <insert any old nonsense>
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA yea right
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, no
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, no its 30% of everything above a tax free allowance
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, that would be ideal
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: middle class
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, im not saying the current one is fair
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, but my ideal tax system is unimplementable with todays current economic issues
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, at todays standards i would suspect that somehwere in £15-20k is an amount you can live on
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, thats just a guess from me, and that would be per a person, so a family would have £30-40k tax free
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, it would depends on what the actual tax free allowance was, but it might be a good idea
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: the passing?
Jens oh dear
Jens which would you get: Core i3 +2GB DDR3 for £205 or AMD equivalent £180?
Jens or could go old school with a C2D DDR2 for less
Jens AM3
Jens £44 for the 2GB RAM
Jens AMD AM3 socket is going to be around for a while when they release the hexacores for it
Jens yes
Jens can also whittle AMD down a bit with a less good motherboard
Jens yes and yes
Jens why particularly for me?
Jens also, the i7 920 is on clearout for £170 if you know anyone who is interested
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Eh, I'm a bit cynical about CPU speed mattering quite that much these days
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, I'm with you on the video side, though I'm a console guy so for games it's moot. I tend to think spending £170 on an SSD for boot would probably be a better investment for most.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Depends what it'll be used for
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'd generally expect them to want to use more RAM ;)
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Not very much CPU
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Also, it'll maybe increase a bit, but I doubt by that much to be honest. Again, it depends what you're doing.
#cs-york         DaveX1 |  Haegin: theres always wine :P
#cs-york  *      julian- pokes Haegin/tommylommykins/Helzibah/prettygreat/Alan
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i'm in a hotel
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Not particularly useful ones
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: WINDOWS
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It's a friend over the phone
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, but that doesn't tell me how baked the drive itself is
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Again, it's in my friend's house, many miles away.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It would be a lot easier
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'm not sure if it actually is, is the thing
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: If it was a Mac, I'd plug a USB stick with OS X into the side, boot from it, pop open Disk Utility, then be able to check SMART status, as well as try repairing the drive in a few different ways, or boot it in FW disk mode to get everything on it, off, or reinstall OS X using what's basically Archive & Install.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: She could just use it from the OS X DVD that came with her Mac.
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yes
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yes, it's not an OS feature
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: hold T on boot
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i'm trying to give him some viable options that he actually CAN use to help diagnose the problem/get the data
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Actually, was there before EFI, but anyyyyyway
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It completed, all that seemed to fail was it writing a log file.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yep
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It's an old cheap Lenovo
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I can try whacking the old drive back in, though I'd need to be there to do it (partly because I know she'll lack the screwdrivers)
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It's a laptop drive, doesn't work like that
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, but then the new problem of her not having a computer shows up
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: No, it's easy but socially uncomfortable to fix.
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: only a couple ,and interestingly...
Hoffi hey
Hoffi ok
Hoffi u?
Hoffi whagt 
Hoffi *what was the idea
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi would they usually get a snide remark?
Hoffi oh ok
Hoffi  i see
Hoffi by the way, you would probably like House season 5
Hoffi yeah, but there is a lesbian
Hoffi it i svery aimed at guys
Hoffi lesboan sex in the episode i watched last night
Hoffi I just rolled my eyes
Hoffi nope and I odn't wnat to
Hoffi I know
Hoffi I don't think they have learnt how to portray lesbian couples in  the media really. It always seems to be about sex and never romance 
Hoffi They weren't in it very mch, though
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi yeah
Hoffi but prefers girls

#cs-york  *          emb swipes at Haegin with teh sickle
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: where entries are submitted as logo programs? =]
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: makes me question why they didn't block it in the wash-up.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: as in moony type space?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ours did yesterday
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I wanna make a decent language that sits where C does now.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I wish Go would drop out of the internets
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: what do you want to do when you grow up?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I had similar funs at Scottish Power. to avoid the wait to have dev tools deployed, I wrote my thing in IE6-vulnerability-abusing XML/XSLT/JS
Jens there's a really long delay
#cs-york        Quendus |  Haegin: context?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: well, it really depends how you look at it
#cs-york        Quendus |  Haegin: yep, because the surname would be "van der Sijp"
#cs-york        Quendus |  Haegin: so take the first group of non-space-separated names?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: just ask for Nickname and Full Name
#cs-york        Quendus |  Haegin: will you ever need the surnames separately?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i'm using vrapper
Jens http://html5readiness.com/
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, Eclipse needs many things
jarnie I just discovered IronPython and Boo. Love them :)
jarnie IronPython = .NET Python, including WinForms support.
jarnie Boo = statically typed, compiled Python
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: cheek-kiss that missed :D
emb :D
emb but it totally became an uber-riqsué  mouthkiss!
emb x3
emb I have NO idea
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: the nice thing about using pstricks is that my nodes can be all latex'd up...
emb :D
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, no, it doesnt have an installer
#cs-york       blue_rose We should have a hackSoc come dine with me, next year =D
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: fast internets now
Gravis|Milan Incidentally, fast internets here too, now.  Ta muchly! \o/
Gravis|Milan I think we need to fix Virgin...>.>
Gravis|Milan But hey.  I can get my emails and shiz, so all is fine here.
Gravis|Milan nn
#cs-york         sveiss |  Haegin: yup, this is part of the problem... this is why I want a competent travel agent, with access to better search tools than there are online
#cs-york             emb BidMod: plz to be making the tags of me in those hackSoc pictures approved
#cs-york          BidMod hi Haegin
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: is mostly good :)
Hoffi I dunno- i'm off to sleep now, though- sorry
Hoffi ok
Hoffi bye
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: the Whitby trip was +trains but probably -walking, unless you wanted to just take the train to Grosmont rather than all the way to Whitby because of timing :(but I'd be happy to do that, as I suspect would other people I've thought to ask)
BidMod other walking thing - it's a PM because we're not inviting certain people who we like seeing on a day to day basis but sometimes want to strangle. the case in this point may have taken their name from Blackadder...
BidMod anyway
BidMod it's Nathan's idea that we go to the Northern Dales for some walking
BidMod and you may come if it's convinient for you
BidMod which would compliment a trip to Whitby with less walking
BidMod we told you about it last term remember?
BidMod ah - we have none - it depends who we decide to allow to come on the final plan and indeed when they can come
BidMod but the whitby trip is open to all
BidMod me, you, probably Jens
BidMod Tuna
BidMod Nathan may invite some other people too, but that's his business - I'm not in charge of this one :)
#eclipse        rcjsuen |  Haegin: Which update site do you speak of?
BidMod well, at some point Jens needs to find a house (this is hard work - separate issue :|) so when you come remember to tell each other so you don't end up sitting at opposite ends of the same train or something daft like that :\
BidMod we'll find out tomorrow - Sinclair want to give priority to the people there first, but they're still waiting
#eclipse        rcjsuen |  Haegin: What url
#eclipse        rcjsuen |  Haegin: Or is it back up for you now
BidMod the plan B I was trying to subject people to was an IG on the South Bank
BidMod sure - see you :)
#cs-york  *      julian- tickles Haegin 
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: not sure
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: only the committee are allowed to be corrupt :P
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: aye
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: wai?
#cs-york          DaveX |  Haegin: I very much commend your work :)
#cs-york  slugonamission Also Haegin, if you need any help with CYQL, just give me a shout
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: I can see your project, can you just not get anything out of BAE's firewall?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: wut?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: oh, yeah.
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, heres the youtube link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA5hbWyO5RA&feature=player_embedded maybe you can html5 it?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah, that's how i know
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, oh i though you said "Flash....." as in i dont have flash
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, oh
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: never really noticed a load problem...
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: lol
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Er, no...
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, so I followed this to quite an amazing extent..
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: well, i have a phone
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: The closest thing they have to the NHS is the Veterans Administration, who provide healthcare to, er, veterans. Otherwise you need insurance of some kind, though if you're 65 or over, you have Medicare, which is government-funded health insurance.
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: can't use Skype with crappy wifi
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: they have a ball pit
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: it's pretty awesome

#cs-york  *      julian- gives Haegin a nice Mac mini with an SSD
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: sorry, i didn't finish, @rsarver came over
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: I've found eclipse from any repository to be worthless
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i'm just sat trying to bring myself to do some revision
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: then again, i'm on ubuntu Jaunty, where Eclipse is so old most addons don't even support it
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: :P
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: one reason democracy is unworkable
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Actually, they should be
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: No, it's the fundamentals of government intervention when it comes to massive systemically-important parts of the economy and society.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yes, and that's sort of the thing.
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin++
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: subprime mortgage fail? :)
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: oh, yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it
x5315 yeh
x5315 cause they wanted to see mine
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: because only geeks use it?
x5315 lol
x5315 it's ok
x5315 i've emailed them
x5315 give me a sec
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, wow i was about to say something along those lines, so i could go cook dinner
x5315 http://x5315.com/CV.pdf
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: !!!
x5315 any opinion would be nice
x5315 yeh
x5315 i did it in a chronological way
Adrian Palm WebOS Hacked Via SMS Messages
Adrian lol
x5315 but still, they know me
x5315 mmm
x5315 notice how Scala is at the front of the programming languages
x5315 lol
x5315 cool
x5315 it doesn't say very much
x5315 because i don't think there's that much to say
x5315 from what i've heard from everyone here
x5315 i've done of the stuff they're looking for
x5315 some*
x5315 and i know things they need
x5315 so, yey :)
x5315 yeh
x5315 i think my main issue is that i don't know what i want to do
x5315 well i was about to say this
x5315 like, i don't know which job i want to do
x5315 there are several posts i think i could do
x5315 basically, what i want them to do is say
x5315 "we'll hire you, and then give you stuff to do"
x5315 yeh
x5315 well, i've spoken to ann about america and everything
x5315 so it's something we're comfortable
x5315 also, i wouldn't be able to move to the US until October because of Visas and stuff
x5315 so i'd be working remotely for a while
x5315 Haegin: yeh
x5315 ph
x5315 oh
x5315 yeh
x5315 basically, if i have a job, i have a reason to have a visa
x5315 and since i have a job, i'm not just going to come and mulch off the system.
x5315 but yeh
x5315 i just need to get sorted really
x5315 um
x5315 references…
x5315 lol
x5315 i'd rather not
x5315 like i'd rather not have to email Paul for a reference
x5315 lol, i could get one from jalada
x5315 yeh, good idea
x5315 meh, if they ask for one, i could get one
x5315 towards the end, it got a bit annoying
x5315 but yeh, overall, i'd rather not have to rely on him at all
x5315 but if they ask, i can get one
x5315 so, it's not the end of the world
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: You were supposed to now? :P
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Scarily expensive and new?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: it's at the apple store waiting for me to go get it
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: no size :P
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i could always try and find an old 1600x1200 20"
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: oh?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: fair enough
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I kind of want to know what your aim is :D
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: how will I interact with it?
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: It's like essence of ghey in televisual form.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: About a US high school glee club
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: It's moderately entertaining, pretty well written, and when they do their big numbers there's often lots of scantily-clad girls.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Half the reason Glee is awesome is Jane Lynch
redcap00 hey
redcap00 did you see
redcap00 newzleech is back
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: either you're asleep
#cs-york        Helzibah hehe, working hard this morning Haegin? :P
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: while his general manner is a bit dickish, the GPL is restrictive
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, but still GPL is not a "free license"
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, MIT is "free" i think, and the restrictions are minimal
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: yes, this has no bearing upon my surprise at the lack of x5's frothing.
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Yeah, I slightly injured myself looking for the keys.
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: me too, and the annoying thing is that you can't yell at him because he's gone :(
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Meanwhile, you should totally visit!
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: yeah, I'm all up-to-date :P
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: what modules are you doing next year?
#cs-york  slugonamission I meant that to Haegin
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: DO EMS!
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: can you remember who he was? I'm guessing he was our year.
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Why o_o
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: If there was a join message, I would.
emb just run with it :)
emb ^_^
emb I've not worked with AE, so I have no idea how much it ties you to
emb if that's how you write it
#cs-york  *       sveiss pats Haegin on the head and hands him a Xanax
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: It won't be legendary, just pretty great.
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: I'm not blaming my partner
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: he's just a lazy fucker.
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: don't tell him that!
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: nah, that's just how BidMod would have felt two years ago :P
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Masters but probably going to move down to the bachelors
#cs-york  slugonamission This is my EMS too, it's not that bad Haegin :P
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: No?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Yes
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: If I could do the designs, I would have done them when I was sat with the hardware.
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: yes.
jarnie You there?
jarnie Hi
jarnie Over an hour later, still no f**king solutions from Virgin.
jarnie What number do you ring?
jarnie I keep getting Indians.
jarnie No matter what number I dial, no matter what department I ask for...
jarnie Wrote letter of complaint, hopefully they'll ring me...?
x5315 ok
Maddie hey harry, how're you?
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: hai
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, you do, but you dont have to put your pin in
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, its only for purchases < £15
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i keep it oiled
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, but the time it would take me to save up for a decent bike which is apparently £300-£400
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: lies
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, errrm

ClaireBlount i ahve decided mine was just a design project and I am writting it up as that
ClaireBlount so its going better now
ClaireBlount how are u?
ClaireBlount did u have a good easter
ClaireBlount bk to that nxt yr though
ClaireBlount that sounds dull
ClaireBlount i have a purple log book
ClaireBlount that makes everything more fun
ClaireBlount wow that sad, i like my purple paper one
ClaireBlount other than if i lose it im in lots of trouble
ClaireBlount cos there is only one copy
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: the what when
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: whole no warning for me yet...
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: why?
ClaireBlount true
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: oh, now I got it
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, why?
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: you click IE8 and a boxing glove on a spring comes out of your screen and knocks you out?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: I expect if you asked they'd tell you it was 'functional'
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, one) does it need that much? it just a simple selection two) they dont really care about it, its just to appease some protectionist EU beaurocrat
#cs-york     Tinned_Tuna And Haegin steps in with the first one, he's got the bait!
x5315 this is why i need OPs :p
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Clearly the Conservatives are still evil.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I mean, only Clegg can save us now.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: When did Apple say that?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Actually they'll do that in a store for you
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I think you're missing my point.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It isn't a computer. To my knowledge, Apple have never said it is.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It has software to do all of those.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: In fact, the photo frame thing? It comes with that built-in.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'm not sure how that's a relevant point here.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: The issues you highlighted revolve around how it's currently a satellite device, my point is how little work Apple actually have to do to change that so it's a device perfectly capable of standing alone.
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin: according to the student finance website, they're down for the moment
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin: perhaps the topic might reflect this?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea Inflation is up
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, because the goverment makes up the figures for our interest rates, when inflation was negative, we didnt get a negative interest rate
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, HAHA yea right
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, high inflation means the economy is shit
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, High inflation is bad, low inflation is bad
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, they aim for 1%-2$ iirc
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, no idea, but thats the figure they aim for, im guessing its to do with cost of debt
Jens http://cdspower.livejournal.com/225471.html this is one of the lecturer at york's blogs
Jens he teaches some of DOI/HCI
#cs-york        Anders2 |  Haegin it's annoying thats theres no account for the fact that the rate was overset this year
AndyK I should probably speak to you sometime soon about re-genning
AndyK that's fine. I'll still be at work for another 3 or 4 hours so its not a good time for me either.
AndyK I'll see if you're on skype later tonight
AndyK k ttyl
AndyK that's the plan
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: background: transparent url(icons/theicon.png) no-repeat left center; padding-left: 18px;
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: basically, set the icon as a background image of the element, centered vertically and against the left edge, and then add padding to the element to push the contents to the right of the icon
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: nope :(
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: http://i.imgur.com/9JX5O.png
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: it's not? cool
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: surely it's umask=0000?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: you only need to use sharp instruments
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: because NFS is even worse
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: and because CIFS works across more than just Linux, wihch is very useful

#twitter      alexmuller @Haegin: Yup, me too; if only to empty it out ;)
#twitter        TimBevan @Haegin the H Mills that just brought a premiere ticket is you, yah? Thrown by the bristol address, couldn't remember your current location
#twitter          jalada @Haegin Nah, just time to get hold of the latest version of Erlang, and possibly apply a patch I found :D
#twitter    lloydsparkes @Haegin my point was why are they using GMT?
#twitter    lloydsparkes @Haegin i just think that as a british news service talking about the election it would have made more sense to use BST
#twitter    lloydsparkes @Haegin thanks and lol, my cars 250miles away
#twitter        tomscott @Haegin Cheers :)
#twitter          jalada @Haegin Yeah, shame it's not mine :P
#twitter      vanderlily @Haegin Oh! I never thought of that.
#twitter      vanderlily @Haegin Not exactly a license to kill but close enough as I can use certain firearms with it.
#twitter          jalada @Haegin You're using Twitterfall! Not some weird command-line zsh-based Twitter client? ;)
#twitter          jalada @Haegin Weird :P
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: nfc
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: because you can parameterise it with the outer width?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i'm going to see how much smaller my CSS becomes this way
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: ah
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i found a PHP implementation :D
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: how nested does nesting go?
#appengine      myxibrium |  Haegin: that could be accomplished with a simple filter. A lot of people on here have had trouble figuring out how to do simple stuff like that with JDO
#appengine      myxibrium |  Haegin: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/queriesandindexes.html
#appengine      myxibrium |  Haegin: it depends on how your data is set up. It may be best to keep track of the number of answers that questions have.

Dave but I think you have to watch it to really get the feel and yes
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: to remove the comments field from this instruction set

^Tom_ erm, anyway, a quick question...
^Tom_ do you have all or much of muse?
^Tom_ i've lost my archive somewhere along the line
^Tom_ and the eagles too?
^Tom_ s/the//
^Tom_ if you're around later, and i don't go out, could i catch you and make a certain acquisition?
^Tom_ not too fussed, i've got Hotel California, but I haven't digitised my copy of the new album (which may well be at home), so anything you've got, I wouldn't mind
^Tom_ that'd be good
#twitter          jalada @Haegin Yeah I saw that.

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: and presumably the last, since you always find it there
#appengine       prencher |  Haegin: this would be the place, just remember to provide context to your questions
#appengine       prencher |  Haegin: afraid I can't help you, I don't use the java runtime myself
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: nifty.
#appengine       prencher |  Haegin: in python you provide either a key, or key_name to the model constructor; if you don't specify one, it's autogenerated, yes

Jens did you borrow my bibshorts? I found my non-bibshorts on your floor but couldn't be bothered to hunt for the bibbed ones
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ah :]
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: this is going to be the bestest thing ever

#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea, for hosting repositories on the server
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, you dont need to use Cygwin
^Tom so anyway, 5 of us cycled up to Ampleforth yesterday
^Tom a rather bitchin' 50 miles
^Tom easily my fastest cornering
^Tom we took a mile at an average of 30mph
^Tom i was like: weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, oh, corner.... oh crap, a car coming the other way, oh shit there's also loose gravel on the nearside of the bend, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! phew i'm alive
^Tom erm, we left nestle at about 9:45
^Tom and we got back about 1:30ish
^Tom george, alex, anne (alex's girlfriend), and goose
^Tom erm, ok
^Tom i also got a large ant in my eye at about 30mph
^Tom i took 2 pairs of sunglasses to huddersfield (mostly for the bike ride)
^Tom by the time i'd got there, i knew where 1 pair was
^Tom the morning that we left i was wearing the other pair
^Tom by the time we set off, no idea
^Tom and in theory i have another pair in this house
^Tom so yeah, i might have to get _another_ cheap pair
^Tom fulford
^Tom the 2 pairs in question were 2 for 5 euros at a market in nijmegen in holland 4 years ago
^Tom both partly broken, one held together with a paper clip

#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: they do
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, no thats too much control, theres a very fine line between control and freedom, and i think MS have got it right this time
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: it goes horribly.....
Jens where you at with your aPhone?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: the experiment
Jens oh thought you would be on your way by now
Dave hey
Dave hey hey
Dave sup
Dave how was being at home
Dave cool
Dave good
Dave there was a few comments that me and andy wanted to raise about the session. but i will do that by email or skype you  sometime during the week when  your going to bed. 
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: stick it in Jens' room for the next 12 days :P
Dave sorry not going to bed but the main thing i have to ask is minor scroll
Dave when found randomly they have 1d3 spells on them, but there is no section to describe what stat they are in when you buy them
Dave do they come with 3 spells on, or just one
Dave I have read the section in the book. and it is not clear. but you will have to read the page with the talbes and very think
Dave so i not sure i can send it to you, I will try though
Dave the dmg
Dave in the magic item section
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: at that size, do you have enough lines to make it worth it? maybe a 26" or 28" would be better?
Dave just I am thinking about buying some scroll with my reward later
Dave yeah mean i can cast some more veriations of spell, and remove spells from my spell list that i do not think i will cast thatoffent
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: that's what I want to do - like I said, Dad wanted his monitor back - it's a spare for when a workmate of his breaks his/her machine
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: window management
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: are you using Xmonad?
#cs-york          BidMod click and drag works well for me - I can't help thinking Haegin has an over-engineered solution
Dave so what you watching
Dave ok cool
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: is true, but I only have one monitor on my linux machines - hence the use of two desktops - I just don't need that much screen real-estate
Dave cool awsome
Dave what with 6,000
Dave no that what i agree to take and the rest to charity
Dave well i was think a leasser crystal of enery damage, for 3000, a 2nd level pearl of power for 1000 and  2000 on scrolls
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: link says it is - sveiss must be special :P
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: it was made my Alex Payne
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: Alex Payne
Dave that what i was planing as an idea, it might change depends what hapeen in the next session
Dave yeah what do you think, scrolls or items
Dave well I was going to  get some heal scrolls any way
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: ah - I've been told that from a few people. I never manage it very well :(
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: not in my internet timetable for tonight
Dave yeah. but i am allow any spell on my spell list as well includeing the divine on
Dave that are no my list
Dave that includes heal
Dave ok night
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: Firefox sucks
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you still around?

#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: please start using a twitter client that actually supports replies :P
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: it doesn't use the replies API, so even in sane clients which utilise it you can't see which tweet you've replied to
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I have like 6 months of IPAM to writeup :(

^Tom that's the bend i nearly died at
^Tom having been flat out for the last half mile or so
^Tom and yes, the sign just a bit back says 1:7
^Tom with loose gravel on the inside third
^Tom it's an awesome stretch though
^Tom well worth a 50 mile ride just to bomb it along there
^Tom you could get to that stretch on a 45 miler
^Tom (from fulford)
^Tom (at a push)
^Tom erm, less actually
^Tom 17 miles from fulford by road
^Tom round trip
^Tom but it's worth the extra 15 or whatever to go a bit further
^Tom google maps says about 47 round trip
^Tom which was probably about 50 including popping over to the pub on the way back

##java         surial |  Haegin: Use headers to enforce no-caching. Though, that particular hack is used all over the place.
^Tom if i do that route again, i might try not to carry as much with me
^Tom i could feel the weight on the uphills
##java         surial |  Haegin: No, those don't.
##java         surial |  Haegin: Raw sockets themselves don't involve caches.
Racka hi my man
##java  Imaginativeon |  Haegin: would I be able to deploy them as paid apps?
Racka ahve you picked ur modules?
Racka interesting
^Tom yeah
^Tom this was just some stuff on my panniers

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: where did that link come from?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: the only student name I saw was a BoS rep
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: Amit has some bizarre ideas about what constitutes "applied" maths.
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: I guess they noticed that people either got near perfect marks or godawful marks depending on whether they were bothered to do it
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: POP having a 4 hour lab asessment instead
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: I guess they're assuming that you learn as you go along
##java      ojacobson |  Haegin: OOS doesn't write an object more than once without special attention

#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, so yeat is a mute point
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: it's hard
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, from what i've heard PAT is terrible
##java        xXedixXx Why haegin?
##java       xXedixXx |  Haegin, I know how to program, it's just I can't think of a program to create that would be of any use to me. Applications I've already created: www.em-creations.info
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: no
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: nope, it's just a method of specifying a game in game theory
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: nope
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: 60 credits?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you're 4-year, right?
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: if you do DOI, I will hunt you down and kill you
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: sadly not, I have a still image from when I got 2.5D running though
#twitter    lloydsparkes @Haegin we have no proof for that, but i think people have shown lefties believe they are smarter, and have a superiority complex
#twitter    lloydsparkes @aJanuary @Haegin @cnorthwood its just an observation i have made over the past few years, and i go around the internet
#twitter    lloydsparkes @Haegin how the fuck did you get to the point, i wasnt stating fact, i was stating opinion and my observations
##java          csaba |  Haegin: if you did delphi before then it would be familiar I guess... btn.text = 'text';
##java          csaba |  Haegin: when delphi did its stuff it probably also took from visual basic, which also probably uses text
##java          csaba |  Haegin: the point is for the majority of programmers it's Text... setButtonLabel is just... weird
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: the main thing that will drive you nuts in EMS is the 10-minute build times

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: oh cool, I will :D
#twitter    lloydsparkes @Haegin ok then you misunderstood my meaning of pointless, voting is not pointless, if you dont vote you cant camplain

#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: what cpu do you have?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: I've actually had the CPU/mobo for this desktop since summer 2007 i think
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: oh, an intelligent filter daemon type thing?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: ah, the true unix way
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: if you decide you don't need another pc I'll give you twenty quid for it
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah, i've been having some real issues with ATI under Linux :(
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: catalyst 10.1 would make Xorg use 100% CPU all the time, 10.2 was wonderful, and now Ubuntu Lucid is using a prerelease 10.4 because of the newer xorg and the performance is SHIT
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: can't be bothered tbh
#cs-york            Alan oooh, Haegin i think i found the oldest thing in my computer

#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: don't feed the fanboys?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: it's fairly well governed now, but that's a recent thing
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, ANDROID NOT UBUNTU
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: good point
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, that was a side comment
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: as if you don't believe it.
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: me
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: add someone :P
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: how are you doing it
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: add me in the lattitude menu
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: take a lucky guess ;)
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: accepted
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: google latitude is showing me america now that i have signed up - it doesn't know where i am :)
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: nope
#cs-york       Dr_Metal |  Haegin: but "local mum" urges all to do so... I magine gathering all local wifi areals for such purpose
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i don't know, it hasn't really changed my mind about any of the people
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: For pure entertainment value
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Nah I just don't use RSS
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: What torrent client do you use?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: The RSS organiser plugin is fantastic.
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: No they don't?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i need you
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i need git help
#cs-york            Alan silly Haegin
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: ?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: you know that line you gave me
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: git pull = git fetch + obeying branch.<currentbranch>.merge
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: depends
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: nope
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: can i do an alias thing for the gitcommit thing
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: javascript is so pretty sometimes
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: http://github.com/x5315/x5Benchmark
#cs-york          Racka |  Haegin: do you want to go to the go shop or NOT? 0
#cs-york           stewb Actually Haegin, I wouldn't be surprised if that was a commonly held belief
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: no, the fact that he looks like a guy I had a crush on in my GCSE music class makes him a good person. obv.
#cs-york           stewb Will do, Haegin, I just love web sdks, they're so neat!
#cs-york          stewb |  Haegin, it's the C#/Java VI SDK
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: how come you're on IRC anyway? you have ships to be sailing!
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I thought you guys did crazy shipping related things
#cs-york           stewb We don't have any real Java coders at work, Haegin
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: More likely a C system. cf. Greenspun's 10th rule :)
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: oh, much much worse than that
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: lib dems got almost a third of the popular vote last time round
#cs-york           lis0r just has better marketing value, as Haegin points out
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: actually, I wanna pick the one that'll leave us with the least fucked up Parliament come May 7th. But since FPTP is so ridiculous, I guess I'll stick to my guns and go LD
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: LibDem. Our local candidate is a mature CS student \o/
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: Yes. I think I have a sufficiently fucked up combo of characteristics to have a much more influential vote than average.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: any thoughts on modules for next year yet?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Vetinari would be a huge improvement over anyone we've ever had.
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: who teaches it?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: just had my colleague look over the modules. he's mortified that I don't wanna do CGV :D
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yep
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yup
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: yeah, a lot of us did
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: it's 10 credits that you can get if you can grasp a few basics of bayesian networks, Python, and the gPy library that had at least 3 bugs fixed during the assessment...
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah...
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: can we see the results?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, if ID cards replaced passports & driving licenses and they were cheaper, and didnt collect so much unessecary information, then i could agree to a point
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, what more information do they need for passports?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, ok if we could properly secure & stop the db from failing in any way, then it would be a good idea
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, thats just like any other form of ID
emb I was at lunch when you said  that :p
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: I said you can, but it doesn't kickstart them if they drop.
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: When they dropped the other day, due to no internet
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: apparently I don't have permission :(
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: :)
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: Yeah, you want Loratadine.
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: no idea, but my view shows me as "me"
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/tsp/TSP2009-2010/tsp09-10.pdf
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: everyone is leaving to ARM :(
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: yeah
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: a handful at least
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: popular philosopher, sometime Guardian columnist
^Tom ping
^Tom bromptons....
^Tom what do you know of them?
^Tom worth it?
^Tom if i can get one cheap
^Tom tbc
^Tom i'd love an airnimal
^Tom someone who works here has both a brompton and an airnimal
^Tom he says that he can do all the touring he would previously do on a fixed bike on his airnimal
^Tom and it folds
^Tom and his brompton is a bit smaller for when he's just doing small riding
^Tom both look cool
^Tom but the brompton would have to be really cheap for me to get one i think
^Tom retail on them is about 600, right (for the cheapest brompton) ?
^Tom remind me roughly when you'll be moving to york?
^Tom i'm working here til october
^Tom pretty much
^Tom if you're still in good shape by then, fancy some ridiculously long rides in september if the weather hasn't turned bad by then?
^Tom how come you'll be walking across {ex,dart}moor?
^Tom anything in particular?
^Tom evil corporation being where you are?
^Tom aye, exmoor's a bit boring by comparison with dartmoor (although the punchbowl is good)
^Tom but both are lovely
^Tom would that be like a week or something?
^Tom sounds like fun
^Tom dartmoor i know really well
^Tom let me know, i'd be tempted to pop down for a weekend if it meant getting back on dartmoor
^Tom cheers
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Did you sort out a room on TIM yet?
#cs-york          BidMod quick shoutout to the people interested in a trip to the NYMR: is Saturday 15th a good day? (take note Haegin since you'll need tickets)
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: hey
[ICR] Nathan wants the Laseras details to book rooms for his TSP group. Kinda figured its your call on that one if you wanna let him or not. I've no credit, so could you either text the details, or text him telling him you'd rather not, to +44 7545 141579
[ICR] cheers
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: PM
^Tom any idea what's wrong with the following:
^Tom for(i=0;i<count;i++) fprintf(stdout,"%s, %s, %s, %s, %s\n", result->signal_alias[i],result->generic_name[i],result->source_alias[i],result->type[i],result->description[i]);
^Tom  651       struct RESULT {
^Tom  652          STRING **signal_alias;
^Tom  653     STRING **generic_name;
^Tom  654     STRING **source_alias;
^Tom  655     STRING **type;

^Tom  657       };
^Tom  658       typedef struct RESULT RESULT ;
^Tom 660       RESULT *result;
^Tom ok
^Tom gdb is helping
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, the form link? it disappeared from the thing in google
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: for some reason that spreadsheet doesn't load for me :| any issues with it?
#cs-york          BidMod on a tangent, Haegin, is it easier for you to travel for the weekend of the 15th or 22nd? you'd disappeared when we were talking about it before
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: the idea is that Jens can travel to sign ours too
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: it depends - I'm going for a combined majority vote/weather check
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ask Steve?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: yes
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: Austin.
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: it might be worth trying to anonymise (sp?) them a little more - since people are actually identifiable from that sheet
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: (sorry - I'd disappeared for a while) - they are identifiable in some cases, I should have said, because for a few people the module choices are unique (mine for example, although I don't care if people know exactly what I think about the modules)
TheHatMan Hai
TheHatMan You around?
TheHatMan ICR tells me you have power to book rooms in uni
TheHatMan I was wondering if I could steal a room for our TSP for tomorrow
TheHatMan Ah, okies
TheHatMan Fair enough
TheHatMan I guess we'll manage in CS-006 :)
TheHatMan Thanks anyway
TheHatMan Fair
TheHatMan I thought it was worth a try :)
TheHatMan They're all booked unfortunately
TheHatMan I guess we can probably go find a random room in Goodrick or Vanbrugh that's free if we really need one
TheHatMan Anyway, I gotta run, gotta get home
TheHatMan Byebyes!

Hoffi ok
Hoffi ok- sorry for the lack of reply I am sorting out a play which i sgoing to be perfromed
Hoffi how are things for you?
Hoffi How come?
Hoffi Ah I see
Hoffi is it good or bad to be alone?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: noep
Hoffi no. i suppose not
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: did it involve someone with androgen insensitivity?
Hoffi oh
Hoffi maybe you should clean the floor then
Hoffi I guess not
Hoffi I don't think I have ever done that
Hoffi no
Hoffi ok
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: whaddya doing?
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: JNE foo

#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: yeah, that's why I used a decent macro assembler for CTS
#cs-york         sveiss |  Haegin: Comcast, I'm in the US currently

#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: It's not really that pricey
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Why not? It's awesome.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Er, much faster startup/shutdown/wake/sleep, GCD, a much faster/more stable Finder, hardware accelerated QT, better services, location services, automatic printer driver updates, better file sharing, faster Time Machine backups, OpenCL, nearly everything is 64-bit, improvements to Xcode, Preview, Mail, Safari, the Dock, 7GB more disk space etc.
#cs-york         sveiss |  Haegin: that's text services menu, not background processes
#cs-york           [ICR] julian-: the thing you're missing is that Haegin actually seems to like shit things
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: erm, I'd have a brief think about what OS X (and most other Apple stuff, tbh) is built on top of before saying that again
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i'll think you'll find julian-'s list is a comparison to previous Mac OS versions
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: is that an obscure unix tool which sits in the background nom'ing things?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: *blink*
#cs-york         sveiss |  Haegin: "-bash: gcc: command not found"

##mac        Kasm279 |  Haegin: yes but you are just confi=using this poor person
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: that would totally be educational pics.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: you're confused, I did that step too sort of.

#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin, I do, I have to
#passthepopcorn        Templar |  Haegin 
emb when? o.o
emb like in general?
emb anyway, meeting :D
#cs-york  slugonamission Ah, Haegin's
emb yes. yes I am. a bit.
#cs-york       blue_rose katwin, since Haegin got bored and made one last night
emb erm. since ages?
emb :D
emb but I don't even know if I'm serious *shrug*
emb nor do I have any idea if he's interested, lol
emb haha. I was tempted at the pancake party
emb or he gets very upset and never speaks to me again and I look even sillier and more desperate than I already do :D
emb lol what?
emb "My friend fancies you"? :D
emb upon your head be it, I guess :D
emb <- not an endorsement
emb at all.
emb ever.
emb honest :)
emb lol, if you want to be nosey about the freshers...
emb I just might wind up disappoitned
emb and *I* didn't ask -.-
emb xD
emb that would be lulz.
emb I think this is treading dangerously close to me asking you :P
emb *giggles*
emb wing cyberman?
emb no comment :]
emb other thought is that MikeT *then* DaveX might be horrifically mean on Alex.
emb (he seemed to like him when I saw them together...)
emb but that's just speculation
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: re: libvirt, it's nice in the same way that pulseaudio was nice a year ago
emb DaveX? what did you say? >>
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: as for android vs. iphone, android isn't as homogenous, and not quite as snappy, but on the other hand you actually get multitasking and it's free to develop for
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: virtualbox is getting multi-monitor support :D
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: also, you use jekyll, maybe you can answer something
emb ok. :P
emb so long as it wasn't
emb "em fancies you" :D
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: as in, if you want to references one blog post from another blog post
emb x_x;;;
emb lol. :P
emb lol? :D
emb might do, I s'pose
emb or could make me look like a creepy 3rd year perve
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: basically, i'm replicating almost all of Jekyll at the moment mainly because it's written in Ruby and doesn't support restructuredtext
emb x_x;;;
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: http://github.com/alanbriolat/reSTsite
emb bah, now I'm curious xD
emb tease.
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i think i figured a way to extend link syntax for site-relative links
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, most of the papers hadnt declared by then, but it builds the closer and closer you get to an election
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea i saw that, i think its slightly biased, theres other ones which are better
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, im doing a Dawn leaflet drop in york outer, then telling, then door knocking
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, the Lib Dems will be doing the same
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, and they will when its only 203 votes needed to swing the seat
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, of course you would, what ever happens its gonna be a good day
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: ozzy!
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: heh, no, got a whole year to go still :p
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: the thing you seem to be missing is that Labour as now is pretty much indistinguishable from the tories just before they were ousted
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: they're a wildcard
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, the economy is far more important than the voting system
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, good for you then
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, why?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i think thye accounted for them quite, well and what ones dont you agree with?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i have and its been dicussed, as a overly biased, and 1 sided article
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, some of the tory tax cuts i think now is the wrong time for them, but the lib dem tax cuts are in the wrong decade
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, both, we cannot afford a 16.5billion tax cut now (well 22billion according to the treasury)
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: current law
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: they'd be arrested under current laws, labour have not only refused to revoke them, but also added in all sorts of bits and pieces around the periphery to give added reasons to be porsecuted
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: was tried, and failed
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I think that's the point
DaveX hey?
DaveX yeah not bad , yourself
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ping
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: are you being around on Thursday night for incisive political commentary and witty banter? :p
emb yeah, just saying "ta" won't makei t obvious xD
emb haha
DaveX ah fair, I'm rather glad I've got my work over an done with
#cs-york           DaveX you're seeing Hammerfall Haegin?
DaveX well I'd assume some time after be both agree on getting married, I assumed that's how it normally works :P
DaveX haha if you want to call it flirting :P
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: http://www.isildursbane.se/ are awesometastic. progmetal
DaveX heh its more of a situation of emb failing at flirting and me pulling her along for giggles
DaveX yeah I know, I do try and tell her to stop when she goes too far with it
DaveX hmm well like I said, I dont let it get too far to be anything that could be taken as anything serious
DaveX mind she does read into things a great deal
DaveX haha ah fair do's :P
emb oh dear.
emb that wouldn't really be fair, would it?
emb tl;dr?
emb is what I thought ^_^
emb and is what I was doing. but I'd still not say no :3
emb and might have been a little bit excitable if he did fancy me xD
emb ¬¬
emb haha
emb no talk of love plx xD
emb something like that.
emb anyway, I'd not wish me on him, lol
emb in my current state of wargh
emb oh, I don't doubt that I can pull off hot. just don't want someone dragged into the wargh :p
emb :3
emb heh
emb I'm a bit attachey.
emb true
emb I just hope Mike will come to his senses ¬¬
emb haha :P
emb DaveX doesn't fancy me and I'm not in York, not a great hand to begin with \o/
emb haha. I don't know people in Manchester :P
emb but I'm in York on 3rd of July onwards :D
emb well I has a Liam. but it's polyfun
emb all of the time I spend with him not in bed is pretty much spent with his fiancé. it's a bit with the awkward, since they need a degree of looking after
emb lol why?
emb oic
emb $fiance = Hann
emb Hann is asexualz.
emb Liam and Hann live together
emb :D
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: hehe, yeah, it's pretty oldscool
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea
#cs-york             emb DaveXi: Haegin did that for the whole of James College in the first year
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: on all 3 machines now
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: reinstall
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I'm totally open to persuasion
#cs-york           liam2 hi Haegin
#cs-york          liam2 |  Haegin: So you'll be at the next ylug thing in sprit?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i could just use 64bit IE, same as FlashBlock
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: firefox doesn't need flash to crash
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, i wouldnt go to firefox, i would go to chrome first
#cs-york          liam2 |  Haegin: same here, it used to be terrible though
Dave hey
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you sound surprised!
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, and their would be 10% less MPs in the next one if Cameron gets in
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea camerons said about cutting down the summer break they get, because its ridicously long

#cs-york  slugonamission Hai Haegin
#cs-york    Sparky_Prac |  Haegin, it may go to referendum, if it can pass through the house of commons
#cs-york    Sparky_Prac |  Haegin, i dont think PR is more democratic, due to the coalition situation we get into
#cs-york    Sparky_Prac |  Haegin, its more representive but not democratic
#cs-york          lis0r |  Haegin: AKA mob rule
#cs-york    Sparky_Prac |  Haegin, that happens in PR with coalitions, in fact it happens with every system
#cs-york    Sparky_Prac |  Haegin, Alternative Vote
#cs-york    Sparky_Prac |  Haegin, its a bit like STV
#cs-york    Sparky_Prac |  Haegin, basically every MP would have to get 50% at least of the vote to be elected in each consituency
#cs-york        Pyritie |  Haegin: new tab?
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: I never tend to care for vocals, I find those inoffensive
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Yeah I was worried about that.
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: The DVD quality one which is not fully edited
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: It'll be similar to the version of X-Men origins
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: Haskell is more functional than F#. Well, more pure anyway.
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: ><
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: tell him "No, just no." from me.
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: fun
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: we didn't do the basics of OO, we did the basics of ADTs
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: an object you create the object, and you use the object to access the objects data and the objects behaviour
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: uuuh...
#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin: i have all of himym
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: not entirely sure yet. And possibly not, due to the fact we may need the next committee to start before this term ends. I'll see what I can do
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: unfortunately not
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, no idea, have you used the same code twice? changed lots of hardware?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, most people dont get any hassle (who have it legally)
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, not shitty OS, just shitty Activation
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea, its called Linux, it may not cost you money, but you pay for what you get
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, it hasnt stopped you using it yet
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, not for 30 days
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, what did you do? just retype in your product code and activate?
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, oh i quite like how all the lib dem posters and billboards in York have disappeared considering they said "Lib Dems winning here" when they lost :p

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: point. oh well
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: call me mr Cynical, but I'm not certain that's the best way to choose your political opinions
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Sparkesinator would blow a gasket
#cs-york           lis0r bidmod and haegin are crzy
#cs-york           lis0r No Haegin, it's choosing not to take part in your own oppression
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: yes. A linked list and then a linked list of special items :P
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: you might be thinking of an iterator or zipper
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: I would maintain a seperate pointer
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: reference thenb

#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: message on google docs
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: those. I don't mean real strands. so that'd be weird and wonderful programming vs hardcore maths, basically
#cs-york           [ICR] But I have a cool idea of something to do with Haegins data :D
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: nah, that's just an illusion
#cs-york    Tinned_Tuna |  Haegin: fair enough
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: it closes the door to SDM. lol.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: oh, ok
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: They filmed it just after the election, with Lembit Opik..
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: The Lib Dem MP, who just lost his seat

#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: op it to kick people who karmaspam.
#cs-york @          emb |  Haegin: make nicks case insensitive
#cs-york           lis0r I'm fairly sure haegin wrapped it up in one line yesterday

#cs-york           [ICR] emb: dunno, ask Haegin
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: at least you don't have any negatives :P But not as strong an agreement as emb

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: even from milan?
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Yep. Massive e-drama.
#cs-york    prettygreat |  Haegin: Pham's been pocketing donations, so the good staff decided to take a full copy of the site and shift it

prettygreat Eh
prettygreat I'm always here

#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: I believe I can offer an entire room for you to stay in this weekend.
#cs-york       blue_rose guys, I'm starting to look about trying to get hacksoc ratified. Anyone want to add any ideas/random comments about the soc for the aims and general nature of future hacksoc
#cs-york         laser` |  Haegin: I believe other departmental societies are ratifised and have similar narrow aims
#cs-york          laser` (which is historically why Hacksoc hasn't been ratified)
Sunshard Apologies if this is wrong, but are you considering staying over at our place?
Sunshard If so, sounds good. I have snacks and alcohol I can't finish
Sunshard Roast Beef & yrokshire pudding flavoured crisps aren't bad, but I'll stick to kettle crisps
Sunshard Room you might be staying in is actually in pretty good condition.
Sunshard *nods*
Sunshard welcome the idea. It's a good room. shame to waste it.
Sunshard Tuna
Sunshard aye
Sunshard I see no problems.
Sunshard Back to MCP ><
Sunshard 425 words within the limit
Sunshard need to finish describing everything
Sunshard resorting to flowcharts >_>
Sunshard looks hilarious

Jens you said house before?
Jens Cameron: political system "in need of reform"
Jens effing Osborne likely to be Chancellor
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I'd avoid it where possible
Jens at least it will be Osborne who makes cuts and can take the fall
Jens they have got some commitment to reform
Jens the system labour promised (AV) would still leave libdems withonly 72 seats)
Jens "Vincent Cable will be chief secretary to the Treasury"
Jens Osborne's deputy basically
Jens "The position's responsibilities include negotiating with departments about budget allocations, public sector pay, welfare reform, and procurement policy."
Jens so welfare may be slightly safer
Jens 'the current vice-president of the federal executive [of the Lib Dems] is Brian Orrell, who used to play a Cyberman in Doctor Who' -
#cs-york    tommylommy2 |  Haegin: ?
#cs-york           x5315 Haegin…
#cs-york    tommylommy2 |  Haegin: This is a text SSH session... The point of emacs is to divide the screen output with multiple emacs windows
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: old xmlrpc (i.e. the version shipped by every fucking distro) doesn't support 32-bit ints
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: the trick is to use the to_xb functions, etc.
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: non-existant
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: unfortunately, what it works with is a bit... unpredictable
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: also, if you want reference, the rtorrent code is actually not a bad place to start, because the "query language" that is described in the xmlrpc stuff is pretty much exactly how the rtorrent ncurses frontend gets its data
Gravis You say that, but I think I actually like the general style better than the song.
Gravis Although I have heard of them before, I've never actually listened to them before.
Gravis Alestorm, Eluveitie, possibly Firewind, too.
Gravis Interested, yes, but I dunno if I'll be up to it yet.
Gravis And I know
Gravis Again I already knew (:
Gravis I don't use twitter, but I noticed you inviting people on the channel.

#cs-york          BidMod julian-: we should probably fill you in - for a while Haegin was running a bot that recorded karma, controlled by adding either ++ or -- to the end of someone's name

#cs-york          BidMod (I assume here Haegin has filled you in with the plan - I can repeat if necessary)
#cs-york        daeghnao I shall do my best to deliver Haegin to you on time and in proper shape.
#cs-york          BidMod also, Haegin and daeghnao, what are you doing for food on Friday and Saturday?
#cs-york          BidMod daeghnao: it's possible you might need to supply him with sandwiches (I'm sure kit form is OK :P ) - I won't know until tomorrow if we'll be able to get to Whitby in time for the chip-shop. the reason I ask btw is I wondered what Haegin was doing for food, and he was going to see what you were doing first
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: you've used Steam before, yes?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: why is it so slow for me :(

#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: what are you doing for tea tomorrow? or do you still not know?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: not particularly - she's going to ask maud and lis0r
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: how much do you know about how the JIT deals with classes-upon-classes-upon-classes?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: e.g. a class has a member which is an instance of another class, whose methods are called by the containing class's methods...and so on downwards
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: that was shorter, right? :p
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: you frequently have two sisters?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: well you now know how long your sisters take, not how long girls in general take
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: but yeah, really don't know how you'd test for it, other than reading the JVM source or scanning memory by hand :P
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: the idea would be as far as possible to eliminate classes that don't escape from a single owner
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: what do you think I'm suggesting?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: inlining a class like you'd inline a function
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: obfuscating code at work?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: ever had the obfuscation introduce a bug?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: I doubt it
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: the core IP of stuff tends to be certain algorithms that you might be able to reverse-engineer from the bytecode
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: is it source-level transformation or bytecode?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: if it's not worth it, then it's probably not worth obfuscating in the first place
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: even if it's worthless?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: especially in your department :P
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: o rly?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: right, but the fact it's compiler protects against thefirst
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: right, so it's something called from within Java itself? then your reflection only needs to be accurate down to the level of the interface you publicly expose, presumably?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: how unsurprising :P
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i already did my bit as a responsible employee last year, i actually paid attention to the markings on documents i was reading
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: so reflecting it counts as it escaping in whatever heuristic you're using to identify classes that can be eliminated. that's fine, surely?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: which in particular?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: remember that my department had a separate development network without all the draconian security measures
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: eh, everything i worked on was based on the AIP network
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh…
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i got an email a few days ago telling me to expect an email in a few days
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: have you noticed that ubuntu installs have erlang by default now?
x5315 hey
x5315 i don't know where you're upto
x5315 but i've pretty much got the job
x5315 yeh

#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: more XP by managing to get food from the freezer with no damage to yourself (or it)
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: even more XP if you can get the workmen digging up the road outside my window to shut up!

#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: I can nom on free fruit at orbis
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: exactly -.-
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: lawl
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: Not in terms of people that I know
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I don't personally care about anyone who has had bad experiences with deadly hi-tech weapons
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: It's an addiction, not a choice
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: not necessarily
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: You don't get to make a reasoned decision about stopping
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: strength of will is a bollocks argument kthxbai
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: bollocks
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: gambling is kind of fucked up

#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: it does
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: who are you working for atm?
#cs-york  *          emb hits Haegin with the fallacy stick
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: it was so long ago, it was actual TV
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: But you can't be genuinely angry at close family and family friends who have these addictions...
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i need my OPs back
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: hahahaha
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: I'm generally against it
Dave so what do you think
#cs-york      Pola_bear |  Haegin: you know no one addicted to caffiene?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: it makes sense until you take the caffeine away and they get touchy about light-weight issues :|
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: same applies to other addictions tbh
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: "I just don't want to"
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: it can last from a couple of days to a year :(
Dave ok
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: I'm generally very skeptical of myself so every thing I've ever done regularly that could be considered addictive I've stopped for at minima a year
Dave ok
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: But they're addicted
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: people are idiots
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: that's my attitude to computer repair - my first check is always for Limewire ;)
Dave are you winning
Dave ok that sucks
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: tobacco, it's like, worse than crack
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: lol

#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: probably the same here - though I'm fairly certain you drink less than I do
Dave ok it is good
Dave ok
#cs-york          BidMod ^Tom_, Haegin: tbh, it's sensible to treat the cycling limit as the driving limit - no need to go wild :P but a cool cider in a sunny beer garden is nice :)
Dave 33

Dave HP of 203
Dave yeah
Dave that better then my 11

#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: for the love of God, no
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I spent twice as much on an iPad
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin, they fall to bits
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Have you read actual reviews of them?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'd say the Lenovo route if you're getting a Windows box.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: In terms of the specific laptops? Review sites will be better than us.
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: fagbook?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: You also get quite nicely designed hardware, but anyway..
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: For build quality/design stuff, that's partly why you need an actual review of the box in question, though I've heard good things about the Thinkpads, not so sure of modern Lenovos.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: ?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: How well something is designed/built doesn't mean anything to you beyond years it lasts?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Ah, you're a "box of bits" person.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Because it's nicer to use? Feels more solid? Also, I said designed/built.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'm not saying longevity *isn't* an issue, but that it's not the only one.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Design is about more than just build quality, you do get that, right?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, so you don't understand design
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Would you argue that using magnets in place of a display clasp in addition to using them to activate sleep via the Hall effect is build quality or aesthetics?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: What about using two light sensors hidden under each speaker grille to not only change backlight brightness, but also to activate the backlit keyboard is build quality or aesthetics?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Design is first and foremost, how something works. Build quality and aesthetics obviously come into it, but form follows function.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'm just making the point that it's about more than just build quality.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Personally I like a trackpad that can recognise 11 separate points (and their size etc.), optical in/out, a magnetic power adapter that you can't yank my computer off a desk accidentally via, a stonkingly sized and carefully managed battery pack that not only lasts easily twice as long as most laptops on a charge, but which also lasts 5 years without its capacity dropping below 80% of what it was when it was new, the aforementioned backlit
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I tried it with my nose :P
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: For me it's basically that aside from that I'm lucky enough to be able to spend a bit more on my computer, I figure when I divide the price premium by the time I spend on it, it ends up being so insanely cheap that it's easily worth it for a much better experience overall.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Sure
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Anyway, Lenovo have a good reputation via IBM, but definitely look at an actual review of the computer in question before buying. Also, see if you can somehow buy one from Microsoft, as if it's like the ones in their stores, it'll come sans crapware.

#cs-york      User_4574 |  Haegin wins at most things Linux
Dave hey
Dave I guess you have tome of battle, is the Templar class in it and is it prestige of normal
-715093116 hey
Dave I guess you have tome of battle, is the Templar class in it and is it prestige of normal
Dave ok that fine
Dave ok do you know what book it is in
Dave it might be a four ed feat
Dave will it is in the book of nine swords accornly
Dave sorry class
Dave well it might be in the four ed version of that book
Dave online as on of the power builds
Dave I have sent you a new idea for my char
Dave no it was just Templat
Dave sor r
Dave yeah I have UNcanny dodge
Dave No uncanny dodge means you keep your dex when flat footed
Dave and imporved  means you can not be flat footed
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: it wasn't working before?
Dave yeah it was the best way to get the same damage with a one handed weapon
Dave yeah but the MOd fortertation means it is 75% chance for thinks like flat footed, sneak attacked and crits and over attack
Dave not working
Dave 5D6 +11
Dave  but I have A DR of 11
Dave ok so yeah take off 11 that 38 per attack
Dave I have 213 HP so 30 damage 6-8
Dave times
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: how is the weather in Bristol?
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: The people seemed to be more interested in vast quantities of booze.
Dave yeah
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Travelled home yesterday, entirely without incident
Dave what do you think marc will do when I tell him that i have a Damage reduction 11/-
Dave there is a feat in savage specials 
Dave it gives my DR2/- and you can take it mulitple times and stack with other types of DR
Dave so I took it 4 times
Dave y
Dave 5 +3 bouns
Dave Plus hex blade
Dave but it is one ok three
Dave well i was not sure if giveing sarah a shield bouns was worth it 
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: People have in the past?
Dave compair to 4 dr
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: We ought to have a spare slot on Friday night still, assuming the missuses are OK with it, you're welcome to drop by.
Dave yeah so as I plan to soak your damage, have a high dr is good
Dave and I do not really know of any feats I want
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: Well, will see what the others think
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: It's a two-seater, I think.
Dave and I did not think I need to max my damage out
Dave yeah so dr and energy resistance , high AC
Dave ok
Dave yeah I was just planing an hour or two if andy get there
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: fucking bizarre
Dave yeah the game should be interssting as long as marc is not be a bigger dosh and take the game out side
Dave yeah i hate being hot, and sitting out side makes it worst when if is sunny
Dave yeah  you know you wear saying you could take me my Ac is 32 your 11 and 6 need to roll crits
Dave good point
Dave 16 touch
Dave so yeah most will hit
Dave 6
Dave but that not the bit it is imported that has the level effects 
Dave uncanny dodge aways works
Dave improved uncanny dodge is compaired rouge levels
Dave well uncanny has no wording about rouge levels in the discribtion but imporved does
Dave that means some one with uncanny dodge keps thier dex all the tiem
Dave yeah
Dave plus your rouge level is only a maxium of 12
Dave as you only get the benifit form one of the classes for each level
Dave cool yeah that fine
Dave yeah I just need to write up my char discribtion
Dave ok
Dave I can if grappled
Dave I have a high grapplw
Dave but yeah i will work at flanking if yelled at and i do not mine standing in the kill zone, i can take it for a few rounds
Dave I am look forward to go toe to toe with something marc thinks is hard
Dave yeah i do not mind mages
Dave ok cool i was about to say the same

#cs-york  slugonamission Hai Haegin
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: The last time I had that happen I just told 'em when it was a couple of days late and they immediately sent me another which showed up
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: The last time I had a real issue with them was when they whacked up the price of something unexpectedly (before I ordered), I called them, tried to find out why it had suddenly doubled and while the guy didn't know, he checked the old price, got me to order it and then dropped it to what it originally was.

BidMod if you only travel after 6pm (or 6:30 - I'd need to check) you can get a First Night cheaper
[ICR] ok
[ICR] cool
BidMod £3 - which is cheaper than a First Day
BidMod but you get 1/3 off with a railcard according to the website
BidMod just realised that's cheaper than First Night too
BidMod incidentally, Tommy is coming too - sausage option is either pork+apple or Lincolnshire :)
BidMod tomorrow - can you meet me outside CS just after 5 then?
BidMod that's good - you could probably wander in to my practical in the H/W lab, but some of the teaching staff might be a little surprised to see you :P
BidMod don't worry about being late - I'll lurk in the CSCR if you're not there
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: is it me, or is :wq less painful on dvorak ? :P

SBlore Hi
SBlore What am I talking on here for, I'll talk  on MSN
blore Hey!
#cs-york           [ICR] So, I've been trying to think about when to have the next hacksoc event, given exams and all. Any suggestions?
blore hey - how you doing?
blore Yeah - fair to grumblin'
blore Certainly am
blore lol
blore Who's back in York next academic year?
blore So you are going to need some extra
blore I'll have a word with the Sci-Fi-ers
blore Damn his hide to Hades
blore You wanted an Epic game
blore Nothing can be good while I'm trying to run Epic
blore Oh, you know how hard DM-ing for Epic (Level 20+) games actually is?
blore Retardedly hard
blore I mean DM work time is off the scale
blore Encounters seriously need balancing pre-session as a matter of course rather than as an optional nicety that I do
blore In Epic you can happily run a character with loads of classes like this
blore There's even an 'Epic' class
blore And I have a lot more classes now too
blore I'd either start at level 12 or 20
blore Depending on the length of the campaign
blore 20
blore A year would be 12
blore 2 terms would likely be 15 or 16
blore what the hell is gestalt campaigning?
blore Oh that
blore look, you have as many books and articles as I do, you can lose track of it all
blore Just because I read it doesn't mean I agree with doing it
blore Cross-classing is plenty. You wait until you see the class list I have
blore It reads like Kalamar Spell listings
blore I figured - why do you think I do not approve of it
blore Because I would use it
blore If I'd use it it's either banned or I'm changing it
blore You've seen what I'm like below level 10 in most worlds I find
blore I don't do 99d6 damage. I make the world die
blore At level 8
blore Stone shape generally wreaks enough havoc
blore That spell is ridiculous
blore Waste of a level 3 spell
blore DM wasn't happy with you
blore you fool
blore enjoy
blore Trail Rations
blore lol
blore What level were you playing?
blore You guys were seriously winning
blore Give me 4 Beholders and 18 mages alone and I'll be holding a whole-session regen with you guys
blore Played properly by the DM - this is a horrific combo
blore lol
blore Was Marc the DM?
blore Presumably is was the game in said photo on Facebook
blore I have said it before and I'll say it again: you need to test-run these immense encounters
blore Here's why you die
blore Beholders are worse than Quells - easily - four of them make trouble for your spellcasters who are basically peasants while they have LoS to them
blore The only thing a Quell has on you that a Beholder has not is they are incorporeal and so you can't stop them sticking in a wall easily
blore It depends
blore First off - no wall will hide you from four Beholders, unless it encircles you and is underground in a tiny cave system
blore Secondly, you'll find that DM music is frequently maagical - or the instrument is in some way, or the effects are
blore Anything is magical it is just a peasant playing music and giving your location away, basically
blore You'd have needed to be in a bunker - and that only stops the beholder
blore Assuming the walls are enchanted with runes of Antimagic, btw
blore Before you even move onto the mages, the Beholders have other attacks you need to worry about
blore I'm somewhat surprised you passed the saves on that many attacks
blore Or indeed were able to reach the Beholders with Daggers
blore I'd have got the Beholders to Antimagic the Wall top while I destroyed it with a few mage hands or some other spell, then as it collapsed on you, I'd have filled the area with Rays of everything from the beholders, draining you to nothing before filling the area with Fireballs from the rest of the mages 
blore Then I'd have sent the dragon in and with the golems to clean up
blore Without evasion the fireballs will probably kill you even if you do pass the saves
blore if the wall doesn't
blore and if you failed any beholder saves there, you'd more likely fail subsequent reflex saves anyway
blore Only 6?
blore It is low
blore The mages must have been poor too
blore Their DCs should have been huge
blore They were all stood that close?!
blore Marc!
blore They shouldn't be within IU'd say 30' of each other
blore There's just no point
blore Even so - add to that the fact they were rushing at you having been alerted, so they'd not likely have all come from the same place
blore Unless it was a Magecon or something
blore Erm... detect magic
blore Love of god - just summon monsters
blore anything will find you
blore It is amazing you didn't roll a 1 though
blore Summon packs of wolves
blore I'm guessing these mages were able to do level 6 spells...
blore If they're doing that your saves should be over DC20 against them
blore Having Evasion helps you a lot, but those without it should be dead by rights
blore And you remember what I did with Confusion? That's a nasty spell
blore That works well with Will drains - how did you get those saves?
blore Those are excellent save scores for a level 12 Character
blore I'd have had you down as +7/+13/+7 pre-buff
blore So you'll understand when I'm surprised to hear you say you got +17/+25/+17
blore Did Marc get carried away and release a Cloak of resistance +10 to you?
blore Come on: I still want to know
blore And I'll have three eyes on your character sheet next term
blore This is why I knopw what your saves should be Harry: the save profile of a PC is dictated by this system
blore And I know about Halflings (otherwise it is Half-level for poor saves and Level for Good saves)
blore Even with excellent saves, you would have to take Ref. +2 with every class level to get +25
blore Though that still doesn't explain why the other saves were +17
blore You'd have needed some 12 classes and your BAB would be pathetic
blore Because only a few classes get +! BAB at level 1
blore So even then, and taking into account you were able to reach these flying Beholders, how did you then manage to actually hit them?!
blore You had better believe I'm having your character sheets in after sessions
blore yeah...
blore Gestalt does not let you have numbers that aren't there at all
blore That's not BAB
blore BAB is your sum of class BAB values
blore That's all
blore Stuff the special abilities - you cannot 'buff' BAB or alter it, apart from levelling up and getting an extra point, maybe.
blore You might get +20 to hit but that's two stages down the line
blore BAB becomes attack bonus becomes attack modifier
blore BABs behave like saves, you have basic values dependant on how good the character is
blore But essentially, Excellent BAB is equal to level and never higher
blore Poor BAB in 3rd Ed is a fraction of level rounding down
blore Because of the backbone rules in D&D - certain things are set pretty solid: BAB, Saves and Gold are amongst these
blore The only reason for deviation is extreme play styles or direct rules tinkering from a DM
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh
^Tom_ 2 questions: what have you got on your bike? (ie rack, guards, flaps, bottle cage, braze-ons etc) and have you any pics of your bike?
blore Odd. I though Monks started at BAB 0
blore And a Rogue definately does
blore Yep. I am right. Both at 0 1st-level BAB
blore So your max is 10 already
blore You cannot recover these dropped points, and that's what I mean by Gestalt does not give you numbers that are not there!
^Tom_ braze-ons are the small bits of metal attached to the frame
^Tom_ eg where you screw in a bottle cage
^Tom_ or the bits of metal through which the cables run
^Tom_ have you got mount points for a rack?
^Tom_ ok
^Tom_ with a frame, fork, chainring, cranks and pedals... how much do you think i could put together a bike for?
^Tom_ probably a single speed
^Tom_ oh, and i think it's with brakes, but i'm not sure about bars
blore If your BAB is just one more point shy of that 10 max: you actually lose an attack...
blore What am I saying, you have already lost an attack
blore You are BAB +10/+5 best case
blore Yes, but the best case BAB is +10/+5 if you lose no more BAB points
blore You are telling me you are able to take two classes per level and mix them up?
blore That's not screwing up the rules how?
blore Just take Wizard and Fighter or Wizard and Barbarian. 12 Times
blore Then you get immense feats, excellent saves, a really high arcane casting level and all that evasion crap too
blore The problem with Rogue is it is a middle-class
blore So it confers only an average of many things, such as HD, saves and feats
blore yes, but you've used a class
blore How the devil do you calculate X/Class pens?
blore Tell me all your levels
blore You can actually take Epic too...
blore ...that's how screwed up it is
blore I want to see your list of levels
blore You'd better be getting me that level list
blore Harry... don't make me come around there
blore awesome
^Tom_ a friend of mine said that at norwich there's a place which has dozens of 70s reynolds road bike frames for dirt cheap
^Tom_ with crank, fork, saddle, pedals, bars & frame
blore ok
blore I would never let you off with no penalty for that
blore oh who cares about XP
blore I'd level you in lower to offset this foulness
blore If level 12 gives you a set XP - I'd give you 80% of that value the minute you breach the X/Class rules and see what level you end up on - bet you the Gestalt rulings make sense then
blore Unless as you say, the DM happens to have every monster, NPC and other interactable thing including CR-carrying s such as traps balanced to Gestalt, it is madness
blore In a closed campaign - totally railroading - this is mad
blore And you reckon trial and error was being used here?
blore More error than trial
^Tom_ yeah, robin got one for £15, but i think that was a bit of a special rate
^Tom_ but 30 say wouldn't be unlikely
blore At level 6 I would give you a penalty
blore If you have very little combat, then it hardly matters, maybe in the interests of a challenge I'd make a few checks harder, but otherwise you'd be fine
blore Combat is very different though
blore This penalty for X/Classing makes you only just a level 10
blore This is probably why this option balances in D&D
blore I'd give you Rogue as a favoured class in considering that as you're a Halfling
^Tom_ yeah
^Tom_ robin's got a fixed gear bike from one of them
^Tom_ weird to ride, but i liked it
blore See you - I read RPGGods and they say it works really well when you have it sorted
^Tom_ indeed
^Tom_ it has advantages uphill over a single speed freewheel
^Tom_ right, home
blore I'll have to read my Unearthed Arcana tonight
blore They say other factors do balance it too
blore Alignment restrictions, actions per turm limits and armour penalties to name a few limit you here
blore I'd guess using a lot of bespoke classes bends it out again
blore I'm off home too now - maybe speak later
#cs-york         Comprec hey Haegin
#cs-york        Comprec |  Haegin: you are or we are?
#cs-york        Comprec |  Haegin: not a clue
Jens http://twitter.com/SarahPalinUSA/status/15216694830 argh
Dave hey
Dave hey how is you
Jens yep
Dave ok cool
Jens her background sucks and she blames environmentalists for the oil spill
Dave ok bit bored at work and andy rang
Dave and you herd from andy as well then
Dave I was looking forwaed to dushing off the suit but that not going to happen
Dave but yeah it good be good
Dave could
Dave I guess as we usally all match I hope they are
Dave but does mean we might have to come up earlyer
Dave and go to all the rehersals
Dave possible help the not drink polices
Dave yeah thought it would be best
Dave well maybe a few like the toast
Dave well possbly, try not to show up andy, and not be  so drunk as marcs wedding
Dave yeah and the way to start is not drinking, back up plan not mix
Dave it should be good any way
Dave now we need to find out were to be staying
Dave No you were finding the bnb and andy was staying there as well if you told him. but that might have changed
Dave so when are you buy pink folyd tickets
Dave ok cool
Dave oh he buying the tickets
Dave cool
Dave so when will we know about DnD
Dave ok cool what day are we playing on, just cos saturday is better as no one is in
Dave ok that what he said, it has a bit noise when he was talking about that
Dave I was walking home from work
Dave yeah
Dave wow skype is slow
Dave well You will see shortly
Dave I hope
blore hi
blore you there?
Dave hay are you still there
blore hey
blore You able to Skype
blore ?
blore I got that thing too
blore Bummer isn't it
blore I looked up Gestalts for ya
blore And multiclassing concensii thereof
blore Question: Am I fair imposing an XP penalty at level 6 to your character?
blore Level 6 was the breach point
blore Forums say: Yes. In fact most DMs outright ban multiclassing *and* Gestalting on the same character. The rest impose an *automatic multiclassing penalty of 1 level every 4 or 5 levels regardless,
blore Note: Powerplayers actually prefer non-Gestalt under the consensus restrictions, given the choice of playing in a mixed party
blore There's a thing about taking n classes at level 1 when you are level n though
blore It is a game distortion many DMs are aware of
blore By the book it may not be.
blore The Unearthed Arcana implies that your character should take straight levels in Class A/Class B as most DMs interpret it. Moreover, unless you played with all Gestalts, the party was invalid as a whole 
blore You say all Gestalts of course, this idea of penalising players and giving them the choice to avoid the penalty on a standard character is intriguing
blore Also I'm surprised that Marc allowed you to play a Rogue backbone with Monk in it
blore That's very cheeky from an RPG perspective
blore Now then...
blore That I'd like to see
blore It looks like a good idea, for those players who've played a lot and like to beef up the encounters and players a bit
blore I have to say I'd be inclined to hold true to a Class, but I don't multiclass as a player much anyway - so that's just me
blore So I probably would Gestalt A/B solidly
#cs-york         DaveXi |  Haegin: I think that 'band' is just a midi synth
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: you're on foursquare?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: you know you can do geolocation within Twitter, yeh?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: you're on android, yeh?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i bought a T-Mobile phone
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: the phone was £10 :p
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: starting a new project with only a month or so left?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: also, does anybody running teh project know what they're on about?
blore Now then HArry - how're you today?
blore yeah, you know how it is
blore You decided how many terms to play for next year?
blore I'll be likely to be asking today for you guys
blore Ok, well I'll hold off then, but if you need me to run a game, you know what kind of prep time I'll be wanting
blore Especially if Epic is to be used to describe it in any way
blore Another reason I need to know is it affects my D&D schedule for convention games quite severely. Obviously if I am running a campaign with you I cannot do that too.
blore I know - I'll get four players and you guys can make it a party of 4-6 dependant on you joining, so I'll hold the extra two places for you. Sounds better that...
#cs-york      Sunshard_ |  Haegin: How many levels do you have in summoning?
#cs-york          [ICR] |  Haegin: whats your problem?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i'm here
#cs-york      Sunshard_ |  Haegin?
#cs-york      Sunshard_ |  Haegin!
blore Another advantage of this is you can take whatever backbone class you like, as the core classes will be filled out by then
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: oh?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: oh, that's easy
blore I'll probably ask Paddy for a start, though he'll be struggling I'll bet
blore What's the Hero System?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: i'm assuming that the key/value pairs are in some kind of object?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: tha'ts how i did it
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: context.fillRect(((i/horizScaling)*width)+15, height-(((localDist[i]/vertiScaling)*height)), 1, 1)
blore lol
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: if you want, arrays have benefits like sorting and stuff, but you can't use for i in array because it'll pick up things like length
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: array has length
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: tbh, i'd just go with an object and use the iterator
blore Andrew has been in touch
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: are you using a framework?
blore About his wedding
blore I was starting to suspect something following a recent Facebook post I saw Emma make
blore Or suspect I may have missed something
blore Should be fairly epic, my campaign, but I need to plan it over summer
blore I suspect Cartl may have a campaign world pre-built
blore *Carl
blore I wish
blore He'd be so in my game
blore He's in Scotland, or Norway, or Greenland, or something
blore Somewhere up north (and I don't mean Birmingham)
blore Proper North
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: the keys will be for i in object.object won't they?
x5315_ hey
x5315_ kick Cosmo for spamming
^Tom_ it's a good test that one
^Tom_ the 2 is more obvious to R/G colourblind people
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: no shit.

#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: what error is ocurring+?
^Tom_ i'll need some help, i'll let you know when i think i've worked out how

TomHayward hi
TomHayward ta
TomHayward it's been borked on facebook today
TomHayward thought i'd see if it was working on finch
TomHayward the bad news is that it does
TomHayward which means that people simply don't like me
TomHayward oh, maybe that makes a difference if you're on btlb
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: your face has a flat tyre
TomHayward that's what i wondered
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: have you seen rec?
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: you're getting confused with gibbons - they're the funky ones ;)

#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Maybe do it once a month, but otherwise you're seriously just making it lose capacity sooner.
TomHayward which series of house?
TomHayward 6 ?
TomHayward yeah
TomHayward about 13 there's another psychopath
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Great, it still goes against the basics as to how these things actually work and all the advice about them.
TomHayward sociopath even
TomHayward the one called 5 to 9 anyway
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Not really
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Er, no.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Want to link me to something that explains that?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: You're so wrong it makes my brain hurt.
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Lithium polymer can still thermal runway.
x5315 hey
x5315 do you want to know a secret?
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: How is it better?

#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Link me
x5315 Haegin: you know the 40% tax bracket?
x5315 i'm well into that :p
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: Yeah, it's just that so far, the stuff you've learned has been the opposite of reality.
x5315 £37401
x5315 oh
x5315 well, i'm further than i thought
x5315 yeh

#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I was asking you for proof
#cs-york        julian- |  Haegin: I'd never heard anything about how LiPoly cells were safer, and checking WP hasn't changed that.
#cs-york           lis0r it's especially bad, since Haegin's point was fucking obvious from the wikipedia article if you have even a basic understanding of chemistry
SarahLucyBrooksNeesam hi

blore hi
blore yeah
blore for what?
blore What is it?
blore No, what Encounter is it?
blore Mixed levels?
blore Well, mixed CRs?
blore mmm
blore In theory, but the more times you split it the more uncertain it gets
blore I would playtest the encounter if you want to do this
blore First of all, decide how the Gnoll Leader is going to be different to the Gnoll
blore It doesn't have to be an extra level
blore It could just be better gear
blore He could just have most of the Gnoll's loot on him
blore Which helps avoiding a split
blore Normal for the encounter
blore Single Monster
blore So sum of them all as singles
blore I think Gnolls are standard, but Hyenas will be none
blore I'm utterly redoing 3rd Ed
blore No, it isn't 11
blore It is probably not more than 7
blore 11 is ludicrous
blore 11 is only 2 shy of an Entropic Reaper and that could kill this mob out in 2 turns, no problem
blore If I play a game and want to look after my level 1 party - I set ECL1 encounters as normal with x CR y creatures and make x large
blore If I want it more challenging or dangerous, I make y larger
blore So 5 + 3 + 3 is a easier than 6 + 4 and that's easier than 7
blore But they're all ECL7
blore See ;)
blore You're in a level 1 party, choose an encounter: 2 Orcs, 3 Goblins or 6 Tiny Skeletons
blore (Yes)
blore 6 Tiny Skeletons
blore They do no damage
blore 1 if they do hit
blore You hit them their size means they can't take it
blore So they're one hit to a kill
blore 3 Goblins is easy but 2 Orcs is nightmarish
blore All are CR1
blore So ECL1
blore If x is 6, then you mobs are very weak
blore If x is 1 somebody could die
blore That's a nice weapon
blore +1 *and* shocking?
blore +1 shocking does masses of damage
blore Breastplate is an armour type in D&D
blore It won't be
blore You've got x up at 5 and these are Gestalts too
blore I'm turning D&D into a game that needs no DM
blore Not the first... it 's been done in Warhammer Quest
blore They got it wrong for two or three reasons
blore 1. It was just dungeons
blore 2. The inbetween stuff was very repetitive
blore 3. The encounters often happened as a result of the Wizard's power level
#cs-york         BidMod |  Haegin: I'm on milan - will I need sound for those?
blore That Greataxe is nice
blore 1d12 + 1d6 + 1 + Str damage if it hits
blore No
blore Normal: +0
blore Masterwork: +1 to hit
blore +1 Magic: +1 to hit and +1 damage
blore +2 Magic: +2 to hit and +2 damage
blore Yeah, as a Greataxe then you get a 50% bonus on Str bonus if it is applicable (that means they need Str 14+ for this)
blore So Str bonus is +4
blore These are going onto a series of 6x4 plastic cards I'm making for my game
blore You have forgotten to add all the Barb abilities to the character
blore Maybe improve them more
blore advance them a HD or two
blore OOOH!
blore So?
blore Is it surprising or some kind of problem?
blore Make it bigger, or give it more entry points
blore ok
blore lol
blore It should be
blore How come?
blore hang on, has it got some silly Str-modifying item now?
blore That +5 Str is +5 on account of damage, not to hit
blore +4 racial str!
blore Bugbears are nastier
blore Anyone with Str 21 will be hard
blore Yes
blore So it is +12
blore Use Power Attack if this is too good
blore Check it in playtesting first
blore If you can't be bothered, at least work out the % chance to hit
blore If it is like 50% then definately knock 2 or 3 to hit points over to power attack
blore Always get sheets in after sessions
Dave oh y
Dave 62-18-2-4-10
Dave 6-10-7
Dave y do you need to now
blore Online, that's daring
Dave know
Dave by I like roll saves
blore Hard, isn't it?
Dave and I have bounsagainst spells and traps and are immune to confusion
blore Villain Design Handbook
blore No, well yes, but they're examples to show concept
blore mmm - don't know
blore no
blore I'd hope they'll use ranged weapons on it
blore attacking removes the effect of invisibility
blore even so -20 to hige for attacking
Dave hey ok 'Learnt to program in C# reasonble well'  need replacement for reasonable wee
Dave more formal word for my
Dave weel that was one of the comments I was writting to imformal
Dave no
Dave I have work to do and it is already past 5 
Dave I do not have time for guessing I was going to buy that monday
Dave I know it is gay but things lik I are being replace with the author
Dave and other shit
Dave I should find my mick
Dave yeah I am getting there slowly
Dave hey are we starting soon
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: I can see that, yes
Dave I am online
Dave how do you spell GUe
Dave gooe
Dave that is teh on
Dave ok
Dave I have been all day
Dave yeah were on the other line
blore This'll happen - why do you think I'm making a game that requires no GM
blore At least low play count will be less of a problem
blore Told you they'd not struggle
blore Remember even a good solid levelled encounter will only use around 1/8th of the Gestalt party's resources
blore Also remember if you use an encounter that is saving throw dependant (usually uses magic abilities or spells) then you need to use ECLs 2 higher than normal
blore If I was running the campaign though - and the party were easily clearing levelled encounters with no real challenge at all, I would try introducing the odd encounter an ECL above to see how that pans out
RuthWhite i have just got back from a brilliant trip to Cornwall
RuthWhite but now have a cold
RuthWhite and someone was shot at the end of my street last night
RuthWhite and stu is coming to visit today,having not seen him for about 6 weeks
RuthWhite yeh in Reading
RuthWhite shot 3 times in arms and legs
RuthWhite not particularly
RuthWhite there are worse bits!
RuthWhite no
RuthWhite this is the first round here i think
RuthWhite though think something happened in the park near by ages ago
RuthWhite brb
RuthWhite sorry was on phone
RuthWhite yeh im fine
RuthWhite not too scared
RuthWhite i assume it wasn't just a random attacj
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: I want a) something small, very portable, convenient for train journeys (so fits easily into small backpack) and b) a more powerful machine with bigger screen for actually getting stuff done at the destination
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: erm, you're at 2 boundaries there :P
RuthWhite and i dont think i've upset anyone that much!!
RuthWhite finished exams
RuthWhite starting work on 3rd yr project
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i bet it has no battery life :P
RuthWhite a flying brain
RuthWhite dunno
RuthWhite lol
RuthWhite its a little UAV with 4 rotors that is meant to be able to fly through doorways and stuff by itself
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: multiple hard drives and pci slots?
RuthWhite right i'd best be off and actually do some work
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: sounds similar to mine
RuthWhite you too
RuthWhite bye
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: that sounds pretty ideal; I'm using my iPod Touch for the smartphone aspect, already have the awesome desktop and sharing a server and crappy media-laptop with Alan
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: huh, i wonder if it's cheaper to build a mediapc or buy a nettop
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: won't buy until at least a month or so into the summer
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: cool
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: is it quiet?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: what's it using for cooling?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: i haven't bought Acer in ages, ever since the piece-of-shit laptops they make
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: thanks for the suggestion
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: does it have wireless?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: just found some internal shots of it
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: 3610?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: so far, with a generous monthly allowance + rent, i should have about 2k left over after clearing my overdraft
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah
Alan £15/hour
Alan full time
Alan 12 weeks + about 1 week holiday pay
Alan haha, this is continuing my previous work :P
Alan If you think I'm lucky, try actually handling the requirements of the job :P
Alan basically, the pay matches the requirements
Alan I'm doing a very contractor-ish job
Alan Very custom software development with unusual needs
Alan Bit of training (no idea how i'm going to do that)
Alan Requirements that change all over the fucking place
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin seems to have sold it to me!
Alan heh
Alan it's not bad
Alan and the people are nice
Alan and i'm good at bullshitting when i haven't been working hard enough.....
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: drop what to a £15/month contract?
Alan :P
Alan but this lot of work is going to be the final bit i do for them too
Alan so it's going to have lots of wrapping-up, documentation, etc.
Alan and i'll have to work hard to get it done in the time
Alan on the other hand, it's a 12-week job that will pay around about £8k
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: you an o2 customer?
Alan yeah
Alan They offered it too
Alan so i didn't bother negotiating :P
Alan On the other hand, they would have struggled to find anybody willing to take on the job with their requirements...
Alan whereas i've managed to give them what they want
Alan and as a bonus, they get somebody feeding back comments on the logical consistency of their maths
Alan :P
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: when i last upgraded my phone, i got a discount off the new phone due to being an o2 customer & then traded in old phone for further discount
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: my previous phone was dead, so thought i may as well make some cash on it
#cs-york      Barneseyd |  Haegin: mine works well, other than being slow & enjoying randomly phoning people by itself
Alan ARG
Alan they keep stealing the vertical space!!!
Alan my criticisms would be that the CPU probably sucks balls and so will the battery life
Alan but other than than, not too bad
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: where is that?
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: lol
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: tbh, anyone who's going to gizmodo's live feed for WWDC is capable of going to somewhere else
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: tbh, they've let other people there
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: yeh
Alan hey
Alan you got any idea on remote controlling?
Alan seems that MCE remotes seem to work fine
Alan (i.e. ones designed for windows media center)

#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: my parents are in London...
#cs-york       CSYorkBot Hi, I'm a fairly basic karma bot. Tell Haegin if you want me to be able to do more than just count karma
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: anyone bought a what?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: I think it was about 5 mins or so, you can probably find the slides
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: I basically did a quick run through of what I've done, 1 slide/project or so and then a summary slide of general 'what I learnt' and 'thank you'
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: awesome, strawberry cremes are the way to go!
#cs-york       daeghnao |  Haegin: sure, hit me with it now.

#cs-york         TobboT |  Haegin last uttered a word on #cs-york 18 minutes ago.
Jens any ideas why changing a CSS ID to a class would mess things up?
Jens the thing being styled is nested ul tags, which previously all had the same id
Jens now the list items (links in a menu) are getting generic link styles that should only be used on the other links
Jens ah I think it might be the JQuery bit
Jens nope it wasn't the JS
Jens half watched it
Jens should really try out photographing  people on chrome key green
Jens *chroma
Jens hmm the horse bits are a bit crazy
#cs-york        daeghnao hae Haegin did you see the post I did?
Jens the one I am using the most is ModX which is very very customisable
Jens but might also be overkill
Jens but silverstripe is similar and more lightweight
Jens Apple fanbois like to claim that competitors rip-off their church when it comes to ideas, but the Iphone's dual microphone noise cancellation technology was first found on Google's Nexus One. How many fanbois will admit that their god wasn't able to create this truly helpful technology, instead rely on nabbing it from a manufacturer which it is currently suing for alleged patent infringement.
Jens (from Inquirer)
Jens silverstripe and modx have a nice way of navigating pages for editing
Jens modx I find very easy for templating (you can create all sorts of snippets/variables and re-use them) and is good for variable templates - but I haven't tried silverstripe in the same depth
Jens http://demo.silverstripe.com/Security/login?BackURL=/admin/
Jens it uses TinyMCE by default but you could strip that out if you wanted
Jens it does have a paste from Word button though
#cs-york         Jalada |  Haegin: theoretically yeah, but that requires all other twitter clients to know what they are
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, an annotation wouldnt be limited to 140 characters, so you could just use more
#cs-york         Jalada |  Haegin: yeah
^Tom_ I can probably make it
^Tom_ i haven't yet
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin, Jalada, Sparkesinator: the size limit on annotations is limited to 512bytes

blore hey
blore hey
blore Wanna help me with my D&D game
blore Over summer I meant
blore I'm going to ssue some templates and you can create your own varient encounters for D&D
blore Like get an Orc and level him up, or change his gear
blore I need 400 ideally
blore And there'll be roleplay description templates
blore Room layout templates
blore As many or as few as you want to do
blore 400 Encounters, 100 of each level 1-4
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: library stuff?
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: that sounds exactly what I want :P
#cs-york       Helzibah |  Haegin: what I really want atm is genre browsing for films (e.g. pulled from imdb)
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: the revo has been packed away until after exams :p
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: have to say though, xbmc live is fucking AWESOME
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: did you see the part where i tested 1080p playback already?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: it's all set up by default
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: you got wake-on-USB set up?
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin: yeah, i did it
blore yeah, go on?
blore Right, I need the monsters to be core or based on core MM 1-5 monsters and then adjusted
blore I'm going to make supplementary sets for the Campaign Settings later
blore Obviously LM, FF 1 or 2 etc will be also ok
blore But I doubt there's much in FF as limit will be ECL4
blore I'll send you a template card and then you can put the entries in there and see how it works
blore I may possibly try to get GIMP to do some graphics too, but leave that to me
blore Also need a rarity rating (1-5 where 1 is basically unique and 5 is common)
blore ha ha ha
blore puny licencing
blore I'm not going to publish the game
blore There'll be one copy, unless it is a real success - even then, I'll only make a few
blore Even then I'll only make copies for contributors
blore Basically I need cards for nigh on everything a DM would do
blore But I don't just need bombarding with data - I need it all from contributors in the specified form so I can print it and laminate the cards
blore I have the 400 laminate wallets for the monsters
blore I reckon a copy of this game could cost a good £60
blore So I doubt that many takers will want one anyway
blore 1/3 of this amount is raw materials
blore yeah - sci-fi tonight for me
blore see you
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: 1.03 million
#cs-york           Alan |  Haegin, ^Tom_, i win
Gravis|Milan Torrents, by the looks of it.
Gravis|Milan I have the song
Gravis|Milan Will add to my BSR folder.
Gravis|Milan Bit of luck, that should work.
Gravis|Milan Yup
Gravis|Milan Mine should be accessible to you
Gravis|Milan So if you just copy my entire songs folder, you should get a load.
Gravis|Milan Should just be Stepmaniav4 or something
Gravis|Milan Should give you a few options to start with
Gravis|Milan I also found my old stash of songs.
Gravis|Milan Yup
Gravis|Milan Have DDR1 back again
Gravis|Milan No
Gravis|Milan I saw that people had found one
Gravis|Milan BSR should have the Daft Punk, though.
Gravis|Milan I don't think it's the YTMNDDR version, though
Gravis|Milan Pump mode?
Gravis|Milan I have 4 CVS
Gravis|Milan The modes are different...
Gravis|Milan I hate chrome. -_-
Gravis|Milan It seems to eat more and more the longer it runs
Gravis|Milan I hae Normal, Nonstop, Challenge, Survival and Endless.
Gravis|Milan MOAR SONGZ!
Gravis|Milan You should be able to just use the wheel
Dave hey
Dave how is you
Jens £62 for 1.5TB now - gosh it's getting cheap
Dave Also what so specail about the Ltd. Digi Coat of arms ablum
Dave ok well I am tring to order  my copy
Dave it is 5 pound more and I can not tell the diffence
Dave 14
Dave y
Dave lol
Dave I try that but there was not a section in york or st albans

Dave I am not sure when I will be in a city that has a Moss in till I go to york at the end of this month
Dave yeah
#D&D        Dicebot |  Haegin rolled: error: malformed expression
#cs-york   Gravis|Milan |  Haegin: Done your last IPAM yet?
blore Hey
blore Hey
blore My idea was met with considerable enthusiasm last night
blore Lots of people are going to be contributing
blore Paddy for one
blore also a couple of people from Sci-Fi
blore There were more, but I only wanted the better of them
blore Not the guy who guessed an Orc had an AC of 5
blore Thinking of using Colour printing
blore Can GMP grab images and work them like Photoshop?
blore *GIMP
blore No, they send me the monsters they made and I'll do the image work
blore Might buy a Colour LaserJet
blore So I could say, have a pdf of MM and just grab an Orc, for example and drop it onto the card with a degree of pale-ness about it, so the text sits on the image
blore That'd look nice
blore I need some traps doing too, we discussed how to do DCs for these last night
blore No. Thge traps will have a pre-determined DC, but how do you know if the party sees it before they know what the trap is?
blore Anyone worth their salt knows that a high DC means a magic trap
blore Which is a bit stupid, because you could get antimagic on it
blore oh yeah
blore So we've come up with this
blore Modify existing traps to have differing DCs
blore Print the DCs on the rear
blore and have the deck littered with 'null' traps (there's nothing there!)
blore Suddenly that Antimagic gets awful pricey and the trap may be just an abnormally good mechanical
blore It is a bit win, if you check your email you'll see I've sent you the first of several I'm send out to the group to help create these Encounters
blore I'll send you better stuff from home over the weekend
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: ping-a-ling-ling
jarnie 'Sup.
jarnie When you want to talk business? :P
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: yeah
#cs-york  *          emb waves at Haegin 
jarnie A relatively basic website for a small company - just the basic info like who we are, contact us, opening times, location and a few galleries of kitchens/bedrooms/bathrooms they've designed
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: I'm considering doing a PhD
jarnie They have a site, but it was designed about 6 years ago and hasn't been updated since, so it's...embarassing.
jarnie He wants a new one with a nicer design that's more eye-catching.
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: sent your IPAM 3 off yet?
#cs-york   Sparkesinator i wont be here for Haegin's final year
jarnie *blushes*
jarnie http://woodstockdesigns.co.uk/home.htm
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: nope, only just got Paul's email due to not being in work atm.
jarnie Content will probably be different.
jarnie They have a new logo, and the text needs changing.
jarnie Do you have any idea on what sort of price/what sort of timeframe you think would be reasonable?
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: I'm going to challenge the university on WTF our tuition fees are being spent on this year, tbh.
jarnie ...and if you'd be interested in doing it, of course.
jarnie Static is fine.
jarnie Nah, I'll manage updates. I just can't design =p
jarnie A welcome/overview page, gallery page, contact us page and location/map page.
jarnie gallery page(s), with some text to go along with it.
jarnie It just need to be simple and eye-catching - people don't buy kitchens on the internet, it just needs to get people to go to the showroom.
jarnie Any thoughts?
jarnie got any examples of sites you've done? :)
jarnie What sort of timeframe do you reckon - obviously you're still working at BAE full-time...
jarnie Loving the CSS form styling on donec <3
jarnie Subtle.
jarnie the subtle drop-shadow at the top edge
jarnie Everything's bloggy :)
jarnie Makes sense

jarnie That's cool.
blore hey
blore back home and another weekend!
blore Hey Harry - GIMP's a bit good isn't it?
blore I have emailed you the result of about 30 minutes with it
blore Hopefully you'll like it
^Tom_ hi
blore Hey
blore You there?
blore You seen your email?
blore Have a look.
blore Black too strong or Arial just no good?
blore And another has just been sent
blore I'm very impressed by the results I'm getting from GIMP
blore A work colleague first suggested I use it to save Buying Photoshop CS5
blore Tell me, what do you think of the colour question?
blore I could buy a colour printer for £200-£300
blore But 2,000pgs of consumables costs £200
blore You say that's worth it for the extra shininess
blore ?
blore Oh yeah
blore I have an ink printer - but the only difference is lower res and lower economy
blore You can't really count the unit cost into the printing cost like that
blore Unless I destroy the printer afterwards
blore I'd also put several cards on each page doing it that way
blore I'd have to guess maybe £100 - so yeah
blore I'm only making ECL 1-4 to start
blore This is going to be tested formally at the convo in Oct this year
blore So you *should* make that test
blore Sure
^Tom_ do you or dave play the piano?
blore Have you got anything you're working on?
blore either really
blore I know I still need to send out more core templates for people to really get back to me with monster variants
blore well if you make anything upto ECL4, let me have it and I'll make it a card too!
blore I'm going to make a few more template mobs for people to cover other CRs and then I'll move onto Traps I think
blore These should be fun
blore I think I'll use a Gnoll for CR1
blore That'll be awesome
blore What race?
blore That's extremely usable
blore Hey! You've restricted their classes! Well done
blore I can nerf a Cleric so fast it is chronic
blore So he just took 6 M/C levels
blore Good on him
blore ehm
blore CR2
blore And based on what? You've given it a death ray or something?
blore If it is based on Marc using charge-and-hope tactics I could understand
blore I feel it is unfair to have an Orc Barbarian target Marc
blore Unless he'll be at the front, which seems to be odd
blore no
blore I haven't
blore Why is the MM Gnoll wielding an Urgrosh?
blore What Armour does Marc's Cleric use?
blore ehm - a Halberd has a pointed tip and is two-handed
blore And by pointed tip I mean at the leading end, not the back
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: yeah, when I'm not being incredibly vain
blore Yes. A lot.
blore He even drew it so two lots of cropping are needed to pilfer the image.
#cs-york           Maud |  Haegin: and?
blore I need to send out my Gnoll and a note explaining advancement: Gnolls are +1 and Goblins are -2
#cs-york  slugonamissio |  Haegin: I was meaning anyone with a car :P
#cs-york       TheHatMan And sorry Haegin, but you happened to be the last person to say anything ;)
Dave yeah just check in time
Dave what time today
Dave i though it wad 8 somethink
Dave 640-730
Dave ok 
Dave yeah
blore How goes it?
blore it is ok
blore Seems to be a few dead links on it
blore You got that CR2 Orc for me?
blore Harry, I want to send you the test Gnoll on new font but your Messenger is coming up as too old...
blore ...check your email
blore unreadable?
blore it is 14!
blore remember it'll be larger in real life
x5315 hey
^Tom_ think i'll buy one
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: indeed :]
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: England vs UK. the other nations didn't qualify
x5315 oh ok
x5315 have you seen http://x5315.com recently?
^Tom_ electric
#cs-york      blue_rose |  Haegin, that's dave's problem ;P
x5315 did you follow the license? :p
x5315 hang on
x5315 it's also no derivative works :p
x5315 i'll just change that
x5315 yeh
x5315 there we go
x5315 you can now :p
^Tom_ also, i have awesome news
^Tom_ the hifi i'm acquiring works, will take (thanks to a wire i found at a million to one chance) a PC aux input, and sounds really good
^Tom_ the guy showing the house didn't know the answer to the hifi question
^Tom_ we did ask
^Tom_ it'll take any of the following:
^Tom_ dual dual (left and right) phono
^Tom_ and i'm going to be buying a 3.5mm to dual phono cable
^Tom_ i have one, but it only works when it's angled like so
^Tom_ bingo
^Tom_ it's like a proper old skool hifi
^Tom_ wooden cabinet speakers
^Tom_ and vinyl turntable on top
^Tom_ (which doesn't work :( )
^Tom_ but i might get a new turntable
^Tom_ assuming that fixing that one would be difficult
^Tom_ i can hear the motor trying to enguage
^Tom_ erm, engage
^Tom_ ah, OED also lists enguage
^Tom_ erm, although i think it's only listed with that spelling for one of the definitions explicitly
^Tom_     6. intr. for refl. (in senses 4, 5).    a. gen. To pledge oneself; to enter into a covenant or undertaking. Const. to with inf., or subordinate clause; rarely into, unto with n. as obj. Also, to ‘warrant’, pledge one's credit, assert on one's own responsibility that.
^Tom_ yeah, it's an alternate spelling
^Tom_ which may or may not be correct
ChrisMorgan when are you leaving for bristol? tonight?
blore How's things today Harry?
jarnie Do you still have that link to the cool javascript gallery I sent you ages ago?
jarnie cant remember any of it, and dont have it in sent due to over-enthusiastic deleting :P
jarnie probably has "j" in the url
jarnie Dunno :/
jarnie maybe had jquery in it
jarnie probably image
jarnie gallery or slideshow perhaps
jarnie animated

#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: that's one more than I "need" :/
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: it wanted a buffered reader
#cs-york        Quendus |  Haegin: BITLBEE DOES TWITTER NOW
#cs-york        Quendus |  Haegin: it fetches tweets once per minute rather than in realtime, but it's still preferable to loading slow webpages :P
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: BS to that, C++ with default template parameters and multiple constructors manages it :/
#cs-york        Quendus |  Haegin: just type "help account add twitter" in the bitlbee channel
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: what were you given?

blore Conversely, you don;t have a situation where you have Goblins, now we're never going to see them again!

twitter_haegin [16:48:46] <Haegin> @lloydsparkes BAE Systems has a myIT @ home agreement with MS

blore I'd be surprised if it is much more than 3
blore I'd also be surprised if we see the core 3 goblin encounter - that was made as a basis for those without MMs to use

blore 12 Orcs and a couple of levelled leiutenants and some kind of boss
blore What?!
blore Can anyone tell me what this is equal to in ECL or Monster Terms
blore That's like 6 CR1 monsters, distored because their number is so high, with some pair of CR2 Orcs and then a CR3 or CR4 one chucked in too
blore It this a pair of mixed pairs?

twitter_haegin <antoniamoreno> @CallumSEJv Thanks :)
blore In a packed Dungeon vs a Party with a Druid and Stone shape you think these guys are ECL7?
blore Please
blore Conversely, in a multi-entrance room with no cover where Orcs get the jump, this is far harder
twitter_haegin <vanderlily> Arses, Tits and Whoodleberries.
blore Nah, you're allowed to circumstanstially adjust ECL by apportioning CR to an encounters for mitigating factors such as good charging areas, an ambush, the Orcs fighting in the light of day etc...
blore Otherwise 'Orc kills you wile you are asleep at an Inn' is a bit retarded
twitter_haegin <vanderlily> In case you are wondering... that is one of those ambiguous comments that I criticised people making on facebook.... but it's on twitter.

blore That's like saying 25 Orcs in a 5x5 squares area are a Threat to a wizard with Meteor swarm prepared and standing 100s of yds away - because he might forget to use the spell
blore Or choose to attempt to pacify the Orcs with his Quarterstaff
blore The 25 Orcs are stupid *because* it is a given he'll just nuke them
blore no - 5 squares (5x5 each) by 5 squares
blore You aren't penalising the party because the Druid has Stone Shape really, you are penalising them because the Orcs are stood under a weak ceiling
blore That's a severe disadvantage if you read up on weak ceilings
blore A barbarian could exploit that
blore So could a Monk - but the common denominator is the environment

blore As an average it is more 4, 3 and 3
blore This is why you have ECLs as well as CRs
blore The encounter is a one hit encounter for a fresh 3rd-level party
blore It is challenging because they don't get any rest until the lot is clear
blore And they'll be resting immediately after
blore A 4th level party will be ok and far less likely to suffer any real casualties, but they'll still be low on stuff at the end
blore A 5th level party will get through it ok. And probably not need to rest either
blore A 6th level party will brush it off - it'll be very mundane XP farming for them
blore A 7th level party would be unlucky not to have this wrapped up in a single turn for two good spells' cost
blore This is what ECL tells you
blore CR doesn't tell you this unless all your encounters are one monster, basically

twitter_haegin <SamuelERobinson> Absolute joke. No intent. Vidal as guilty as anyone. 50/50, free kick at worst. As bad as Keita. #sui #worldcup

twitter_haegin <garethr> Spent afternoon at work talking about practical web ops stuff. Now relaxing on the train reading Web Operations book. Should get out more
^Tom_ hi
^Tom_ fancy solving a puzzle?
^Tom_ right, here's the basic theme...
^Tom_ there are several robots
^Tom_ and they're on a grid
^Tom_ a robot can move in any of the 4 directions (UDLR) in a straight line
^Tom_ and it will keep going until it hits something
^Tom_ and there aren't any walls
^Tom_ and robots aren't allowed to be sacrificed for the cause
^Tom_ the goal is to get the red robot to the centre square
^Tom_ that's basically it
^Tom_ are you on a monospace font?
^Tom_ so for example:
^Tom_ ....y
^Tom_ ..g..
^Tom_ .b#..
^Tom_ ...o.
^Tom_ ....r
^Tom_ the aim is to get the r to the #
^Tom_ bingo
^Tom_ so the game has 40 cards with different starting positions, but it's always red to the middle
^Tom_ and we were going through them a few weeks ago
^Tom_ and struggled really hard with the final one
^Tom_ i think i jotted down the pattern
^Tom_ good old internet
^Tom_ i've found it
^Tom_ o.g.b
^Tom_ .....
^Tom_ ..
^Tom_ erm, i'll start again
^Tom_ o.g.b
^Tom_ .....
^Tom_ ..#..
^Tom_ ....y
^Tom_ .r...
^Tom_ things worth noting are that because everything has to get stopped by something, you can never get further in any of the cardinal directions than 1 behind the furthest robot in that direction
^Tom_ so the red or yellow could never get on the top row
^Tom_ which means that at any time you have to have at least 1 robot at least 1 square past the target
twitter_haegin <ryan> Honest question @jasonfried: why would I pay $10 for Draft when Ideas (free) and Penultimate ($3) are just as simple and elegantly designed?
^Tom_ so in that example, there are a few POSSIBLE starting moves
^Tom_ B->Y, Y->B, B->G, G->B, G->O, O->G
^Tom_ but yellow can't be the first moved
^Tom_ http://apps.facebook.com/lunar_lockout/
^Tom_ if you want to see the board, type 40 into the box on the right
^Tom_ if yellow is moved first, it can't be won
^Tom_ if we call the grid: x=1,2,3,4,5 and y=1,2,3,4,5, so that 1,1 is the top left
^Tom_ then if yellow goes up, you could only ever get a single piece to 2,4
^Tom_ from which you couldn't get the red out
^Tom_ so if you move G-> O,R,Y it would be a good position to get into
^Tom_ on conversely, we know that the first red move will have to be up#
^Tom_ as nothing could stop it going left, right or down
^Tom_ its next move must be right
^Tom_ yeah
^Tom_ ah, i've just worked out 5
^Tom_ 7's a bit trickier
^Tom_ yup
^Tom_ they vaguely get harder
^Tom_ in about 4 groups of 10
^Tom_ so on 10 you know that you can't move the orange
^Tom_ or at least not until it's been used

^Tom_ i'd be interested to code a program to work out every valid pattern
^Tom_ erm, by which i mean from a given starting pattern
^Tom_ like chaining every possible move
blore something like that

Dave hey
blore you playing in Sarah's game?
blore mmm
blore It true about this level 10/gestalt stuff?
Dave how are you
blore That's a yes
Dave yeah, trying to walking in new boots
blore Ok, new perspective...
blore What level did you start us at in your first game?
Dave it is hurting so much
Dave hope i can break them by next month
blore It was low
blore I think I had plate armour and a tower shield, maybe a mwk weapon
blore so 3 is likely, 4 at most, but 3 seems more the area
Dave do not know, walking with blistor
blore Marc started at 1
blore I started at 1
blore Paddy started at erm. 1.
blore So Sarah does 10/gestalt
blore this is... ambitious
Dave what have you been up to
blore given your own ability to handle moderate level mixed encounters raised for gestalt it does concern me
blore what's more, I get the feeling Sarah's not read any GM forums on this
Dave ok so she is running
Dave damm
Dave about what
Dave well is simon playing
Dave '
blore Guess I'm worries you'll either breeze it or get squashed by something silly and resent playing
blore no
blore you guys never invite me, do you?

blore How do you feel about starting D&D at level ten and then doing Gestalt on top of that?
blore ...as a new GM?
blore Harry... Sarah isn't letting you use this is she?
blore This Chaining rule?
Dave then y does simon know
blore yes
twitter_haegin <textfiles> No, seriously, I have my credit card out. Create a hardware video noise reducer, Neat Video, and I will buy 3.
Dave yeah but I like some of them
blore erm, some exceptions may apply here
blore if you can attack twice and have mobility you might get off
blore if you have mobility and leap diagonally past you would get off
Dave yeah there all good
blore if your opponent was out of AoOs then you would also get off
blore yeah - that's where I'm going
blore I've nothing against the feat. at all - just the general use it sees
blore attacking for no reason better than to run around an enemy is flagrant metagaming
Dave so why is sarah starting so hight
blore the clear intent of the feat is seriously to attack a foe then get out of threat area, to outmaneouvre them
blore you have thought of that. in a game I ran
blore ok. Dave thought of it. In front of you
blore either way it is an abuse of the feat
Dave well it is a bit high but how long is she planning on running
blore no
blore flurry of blows is for fists
blore two-weapons fighting (as the name may imply) is for armed combat
Dave It is good start for a one off
blore this is actually important as Monk fists are specially lethal
blore and a fist is like a superlight weapon
blore two-weapon fighting is designed to manage those oppressive pens for actual blades
blore light as in lighter than say a dagger with a sword in armed fighting
blore because both are light
blore but they're nonlethal *unless* you happen to be a Monk
blore I think they are not light if you wear a gauntlet though
blore no, because they then become not fists
Dave I will look in the compudium
blore I'm pretty certain if you really read Monk properly the answer is there
blore It'll say when (and I think the word is) 'unarmed'
blore Two weapon fighting specifies a different effect too
blore Again, the rule would be in the words, but I'd bet it makes a reference to an actual pair of weapons, and despite what Ch. 7 says, I would not agree a fist set is 'a pair of weapons'
Dave boots of skating or the boots of striding
blore you may also want to check multi-weapon rules
blore scimitars are all non-light
Dave first +10 ft  and +20 on sloped ground
blore I may rule you to be -18/-14/-10/-6 to all attacks if it were me
Dave the other +10ft and +5 jump
blore then it does not get much better
blore normal sword/dagger attacks are -6/-2 right?
Dave no constant, i can give the per day iteams if you like
blore Ok, but you haven't decided to yet
Dave 5k5
blore Right, next, what is the name of that feat?
blore seriously?
blore and I do not mean multiattack, this is different
blore I know this
twitter_haegin <lloydsparkes> i will achieve alot of things on my todo list tommorow, i will
blore No raised pre-reqs?
blore That's sick and wrong
blore so if a monster has 10 arms it can solidly wield like 5 scythes?
blore yeah. they gave this good thought
blore since you can 'make it light' once you find a class that does that
blore this going into Sarah's game?
Dave ok ready the set on the bottom of page 197
Dave for 26 k
blore I hope it is
blore argh
blore you don't dump Cha in an RP game
blore Unless MArc said it'll be RP
blore In which case bring a tank
blore I dump Str in most games

blore My characters are couth

blore The gestalt discussions
blore Sarah needs to know that 3 in 4 advanced GMs don't agree with free-class Gestalt gaming
Dave yeah the setsare great
blore She also needs to know what the alternatives are
blore Basically you needed to tell her what I told you
blore Done about half of the RP card design, btw
blore Also got several interior room designs
blore By all accounts you got shat on
blore Those be your accounts... too

blore You wonder why I fear it may happen with Sarah?
Dave yeah the two items are amsome
Dave so are you playing a monk rouge
Dave shadow dacer
Dave or are you crossing lots of classes
Dave again
blore I can understand why you do not want me playing!

blore how're you?
blore Jump skill?
blore Isn't this fairly normal?
blore oh
blore I had the strangest conversation with Marc earlier on
blore It seems he's pretty unhappy about my concerns about this game of Sarah's
blore That's precisely the thing Harry
blore I didn't
blore I'm guessing someone must have - he didn't have telepathy last time I saw him
blore I'm also guessing neither you nor Dave are particularly into misrepresentation - which means that Marc's in one of those misinterpretation moods today
blore yeah
blore I didn't - I just told him exactly what I said and that I was hoping it worked out well for Sarah either way
blore He fizzled out at this point
blore Sorry to disappoint you - no hours long row here
blore Seems odd you advise I don't speak with Marc
blore Myself, if it had been serious enough to warrant further comment, I'd have sought to speak to Sarah - being as she's running it
blore Don't look at me - I know nothing
blore 8k base cost
blore add to that masterwork cost
blore add to that the weapon cost
blore and for double weapons masterwork is double
blore Ok, nearly nothing
blore Not even +1 weapons?
blore Besides, you're taking weapons?
blore waste of money that
blore By all accounts you won't need them :)
blore Seriously, I wouldn't plump for power
blore If it really is going to be an RP game you may see very little need for even +1 weapons
blore Get Masterwork ones then
blore Or get something roleplay-colourful
blore Like four weapons with +1 enhancements
blore but not +1
blore So they all have a backstory
blore Oh, shame
blore You're on the right track
blore Specialised materials would compensate well for magic you can't really afford
twitter_haegin <commandlinefu> http://bit.ly/any7CC - Delete the \n character at the end of file (kevintse)
blore Try two two-handed weapons
blore That's be affordable
blore *d
blore ah
blore here's something you didn't mention
blore to me?
blore You said plenty about Scimitars
blore yeah
blore that too
blore check it does not apply to unarmed only
blore if not - then laugh
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: they can be a nice easy get-away
blore sorry - lots of Monk stuff is a bit like this
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: you can go walking at CenterParcs :p
blore not that it matters around level 10
blore I'd have possibly gestalt Monk straight with Fighter
blore Then taken like no gear
blore and piled the feats into making that Monk really awesome
blore oh, that answers a few questions
#cs-york          x5315 |  Haegin: does it involve using Vim and changing config files
blore It is a good RP feat
blore I'd still enjoy the fighter bonus feats here
blore I also read your class-skill-switching-thing rules thingy last night
blore Seems like a potentially good compromise between regular and Gestalt play
blore what?
blore happens to the best of us Harry
blore Sorry, I'm just watching a guy play TES theme on his piano
blore I tend to find I can live with 80'
blore But I'm not much of a Monk or Barb player
blore Depends
blore First of all, do you feel a situation will arise that warrants initiative like that?
blore nice, but will you be making more than a very few attack rolls...
blore Even Marc says it is light
blore Given you've agreed it is light, I would err on the side of a smarts buff
blore Failing that a Dex buff
blore always
blore Because you get AC, many skill buffs and init with that in a single shot
blore oh, and reflex
twitter_haegin [15:38:42] <textfiles> Hurrah! Kevin Schreck is fully funded and is heading to England to begin filming a documentary on Thief and the Cobbler http://kck.st/cwepzM
blore also if you go with that Fig/Mon combo I suggested, you'll unlock a sweet pile o' feats that way
blore For a start you can take weapon finesse
blore If those scimitars are seriously all light
blore That allows you to part-drop Str
blore Good
blore If you take that combo - declare it as a Fighter Bonus feat
blore oh god
blore that trick. again
blore can't say I blame you tbf
blore I stinks from an RP perspective, but if it's allowed, go nuts
twitter_haegin <textfiles> Been a while since I read it, so I'd forgotten the whole metacomic thing with Zonker Harris: http://bit.ly/bAuDWh
blore lol - you always say that
blore Infact kinda is the greatest concession I've had - not finding it hard, are you?
blore and all the rest?
blore I'd have put the ranger where the fighter goes and vice-versa in that story
blore The story is also as thin as the paper it is written on
blore lol
blore at least you've reach the acceptance stage
blore I agree
blore It is a shame about the cash, the Planar Handbook has some very nice elemental weapons in it
blore Seriously, gloves of Dex, Str points in Int and maybe Periapt of Wisdom (but not ott)
blore Covers you for the RP nicely and if a fight does start (having a Cha of 5 will probably mean it will) - you are covered
blore I'd probably go for the more across the board Dex buff
blore Just you rely a lot there on combat happening, the Dex buff makes it not really matter what happens
blore hey np
blore I've done this enough before
blore I don't want to say no combat is rubbish, but I think you are right to prepare a character for it
blore Because it will have combat in it
blore And then there's traps...
#cs-york          ^Tom_ |  Haegin: did you get marathon (plus) ?
blore If Marc's hand is in it it could have combat the likes of which I run
blore Like it or not there's bits of my style in his GMing
blore I would hope he's passed on anything he's learnt to Sarah - time will tell if it drives up the combat or not
blore I think she'll do well though
blore Expect a good game
blore Seriously I wish I could see it unfold, but I should be working myself
blore yes
blore This 'ere Morowind tune sounds great on my piano
blore it is - I can't tell you how good
blore The guy on youtube showing you how to do it is pretty nervous and quiet (I think he's not English)
blore But he teaches it really well
blore And I don't just have a Keyboard like he does
blore This guy's made his own impro with bits of Oblivion Music in it

blore How'd it all go?
blore great
blore much more combat?
blore that is quite low
blore You were right to not blow a pile on weaponry
blore that d100 thing?
blore tbh I didn't enjoy that, but that wasn't because the thing was necessarily lacking for you guys
blore I thought you guys were having more fun than I was
blore It wasn't that
blore It was more that combat encounters broke down into debates as to whether you'd want to fight the monsters
blore Personally if something bears down on me with a weapon, I prefer it in the dead form
blore It was supposed to be quite methodical and planned
blore I wasn't fond of how frequently you guys left Marc out to dry

blore No. I do not think so. But the point is you guys tended to let the Fighter charge in and... get killed
blore Oh yeah, then the debate turned to whether you'd want to play with these guys
blore One of them was Richard
blore You guys really could have cut that down a bit by RPing with one another instead of me!

blore Loot is stuff like items, generally useful ones

twitter_haegin [13:36:54] <Wossy> Howdy. Today's score too hard to call. As for me, I have decided that after my shows finish in three weeks...gap year!!!
twitter_haegin <Wossy> When I say gap year I will still be twittering and writing comics. So maybe need new phrase? Any thoughts...
twitter_haegin <vanderlily> If today is not a really good day then I'll be very surprised- sun, BBQ, football family and that special guy. Just lovely.
blore Try this
blore or you could if you could receive files!
blore Ok
blore It is on its way, let me know what you think...
blore It needs to print clearly in B/W
blore Alternative I could do colour. At massive cost
blore Personally I reckon colour is fine once I've tested the game works well to play
blore After that I can redo the pretties
blore I only have 3.5months left for the first full test
twitter_haegin <simonpegg> Delightful morning. Picnicking on the Heath with the great @DamonLindelof and his lovely family. So much to talk about, so little time.
blore So do you reckon this is ok for now?

blore I'll stick it out to all the peeps then
blore It will make the RP card make more sense still
blore I have a plan
blore You reckon you could find a way of adding a puzzle element to the game?
blore Obviously you can choose. Printing the answer on them in plain sight may not work though.
blore Maybe use cards, a book, or a combo or cards and an entry in the RP book

blore ugh - hang on while I read this
blore Oh I don't even understand this
blore they stack enchancement bonuses
blore so glamoured armour of invulnerability would be +4 in addition to existing enhancement for being magic
blore This is allexplained in DMG v3.5 - and I'd say the costs stack
blore in fact 282 says clearly what to do
blore so 100% cost for the dearest, then 150% for the second and subsequent abilities are also 150% as well
blore add them together and add the base item cost (remember it needs to also be masterwork)
blore (Where mwk applies)
blore they do seem to assume you have some in most cases
blore eg Bracers of Armour cost n² x1000gp (for +n AC)
blore that's the idea, I guess
blore that's another point
blore I read somewhere you cannot have items better than +10
blore Pray tell me what a Sword of the Solars is them?
blore *then?
blore A Sword of the Solars is at least +13
blore And it is a Core Item
blore It is a +5 Dancing Vorpal Bastard Sword
blore Cost: 3.3Mgp
blore Not as awesome as these Boots
blore And they cost 40kgp
blore Gravity Boots
blore You. Want. These.
blore "These leather boots allow the wearer to choose the direction of gravity's pull on him"
blore Planar Handbook
blore Pg 82
blore They're actually 50.4kgp
blore but worth it for the look on party's face (and DM)
blore Basically they confer fly 60' (poor) to you
blore With perfect landing
blore So you now don't need to run up a wall!
blore Just carry a lot of blocks of metal, and unequip them above foes off the ceiling
blore Ever wanted to be a fly on the wall in that RP conversation, simple!
Gravis Offhand, no idea
Gravis 13
Gravis Unless this one has changed now.
Gravis I am aware of this
Gravis I'm in the process of doing it
Gravis Also, it isn't in ipconfig in 7, apparently.
Gravis 00-1d-60-df-61-b9
Gravis Or I could just get it from the connection properties
Gravis I have about 10 entries without /all.
Gravis As I said before, this one is _already_ 13, hence I chose it
Gravis It's my linux install that isn't.
Gravis I will be
Gravis But I never use it.
Gravis Not for anything that needs my IP, anyway
blore cloak of shadows
blore 75kgp but hey - now you don't just get +5 to hide in the shade - you're also incorporeal!
blore and if they even manage to come through the wall to catch you - you can set the cloak on them
blore It is actually a pet too!
blore It is a pet of the Summon Monster VIII variety

blore that way it can cost capacity to ensure it fits
blore actually, capacity cards are in the furnishings deck
blore that's better - the furnings and therefore puzzles also need to fit the room type
blore better go Harry
blore Give it a think anyway
blore I'll work on a drawing of deck relations for you too

twitter_haegin <lloydsparkes> RT @skyeee_: Oh oh, more anti-Budget stuff from the BBC on Graham Norton. Any. Possible. Place.
#cs-york  Sparkesinator |  Haegin, yea, thats a fault
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: What's tempting?
twitter_haegin [23:53:10] <Haegin> @jalada ok, that's pretty damn cool! I like that a lot. Shame it's ruby and that gems suck so much at being installed.
#cs-york  tommylommykin |  Haegin: yes, but that's not the point: If someone did dirty their monitor (say by hayfever-sneezing on it) I don't think they'd be as bothered
Sunshard Erm, is it okay to continue asking questions from earlier or shall I leave it until another time?
Sunshard me too
Sunshard walking + buggered leg + train journey = ugh
Sunshard essentially, it's about types of jobs in the industry
Sunshard the ones that seem most common are
Sunshard technology consultant
Sunshard and software engineer
Sunshard are there any other archetypes I should consider?
Sunshard I'm aware of specialised things like network engineer
Sunshard but I'm not entirely sure I'd want to take a highly specialised role before I find my feet
Sunshard lol
Sunshard essentially rat races
Sunshard which is why they are so hungry for tech people of any sort
Sunshard succinct summaries
Sunshard true
Sunshard consultancies and the like also appear to have the unfortunate yearlong thing. Gotta ask paul keeler for more details
#cs-york            emb |  Haegin: doesn't everyone shower?
Sunshard I intend to try
Sunshard I need to start looking at a massive number of companies
Sunshard since the majority will say "No"
Sunshard and thinking how to tailor CVs to each one
Sunshard I know
Sunshard got drilled on interview technique
Sunshard hmm
Sunshard ooh
Sunshard thanks
Sunshard I like his example of interview questions
Sunshard I remember them
Sunshard I wonder if project euler is a good way to practice coding
Sunshard indeed
Sunshard I suppose comprec could do with some more brushing up
Sunshard wonder how to work python into that though
Sunshard I love comprec. But I'll cast around for something
Sunshard hahaha
Sunshard most of them are due to my lack of knowledge of ubuntu
Sunshard I can probably improve my troubleshooting
Sunshard and then make ubuntu sit up and dance and not just sit there as an ememrgency OS
Sunshard mm
Sunshard guess I'll start by trying to figure out how to get Ubuntu to recognise my laptop's LCD screen instead of outputting to the VGA
Sunshard more or less
Sunshard supervisor meetings begin soon
Sunshard cohort meeting tomorrow
Sunshard and friday's viewing of scripts
Sunshard alan frisch
Sunshard ...

Sunshard getting an internship?
#cs-york       Sunshard |  Haegin: It looks like it has a gimp leg.
Sunshard I noticed
Sunshard that placement students come first
Sunshard basically, sandwich students get attention. 
Sunshard anyone with year-long, department organised placements get a fair bit of assistance
Sunshard apparently
Sunshard to m
Sunshard e
Sunshard he's always out busy
Sunshard he did spare time to review my CV quickly
Sunshard :(

Sunshard well
Sunshard reading the articles was a good grounding force
Sunshard thanks for the links. I'm off to bed
Sunshard I'm going to spend the next few days examining my motivations
twitter_haegin <ChrisEvr> Watching "The Best of Cheaters" and laughing like a maniac. I haven't been so excited in ages! :D
Sunshard because I feel a little adrift o.0
Sunshard heh
Sunshard my education so far has been a bloody rat racw
Sunshard *race
Sunshard and then we had NS
Sunshard I've got catching up to do.
Sunshard catching up at least will be fun because I can at least choose with some degree of control what I do
Sunshard as you said yourself
Sunshard grades are just the entry
Sunshard the rest is proving you can do something
Sunshard I'm going to need to plan a little.
Sunshard i doesn't bother me
Sunshard I just wish I had more time
Sunshard in general
Sunshard not now
Sunshard I'm not actually as worried as I was a few hours ago
Sunshard just exhilarated. and that niggling sense of regret that I did't need to sleep
Sunshard *rephrase that last bit: I regret needing to sleep, because there just doesn't seem enough time to do everything I want to at this minute
Sunshard Prioritise, prioritise. I can tell I'm going to enjoy studying with you.
Sunshard A fair choice
Sunshard that's why we have friends isn't it?
Sunshard ^^ good night. Don't forget to sleep either.
Sunshard hahaha
